<pre><code>Antiquity                   Greek myths of Hephaestus, the blacksmith who manufactured mechanical servants, and the bronze man Talos incorporate the idea of intelligent robots. Many other myths in antiquity involve human-like artifacts. Many mechanical toys and models were actually constructed, e.g., by Archytas of Tarentum,Hero, Daedalus and other real persons.
Antiquity                   Greek myths of Hephaestus and Pygmalion incorporated the idea of intelligent robots (such as Talos) and artificial beings (such as Galatea and Pandora).[1]
Antiquity                   Yan Shi presented King Mu of Zhou with mechanical men.[2]
Antiquity                   Sacred mechanical statues built in Egypt and Greece were believed to be capable of wisdom and emotion. Hermes Trismegistus would write &quot;they have sensus and spiritus ... by discovering the true nature of the gods, man has been able to reproduce it.&quot; Mosaic law prohibits the use of automatons in religion.[3]

384 BC–322 BC               Aristotle described the syllogism, a method of formal, mechanical thought.

1st century                 Heron of Alexandria created mechanical men and other automatons.[4]
260                         Porphyry of Tyros wrote Isagogê which categorized knowledge and logic.[5]

5th century B.C.            Aristotle invented syllogistic logic, the first formal deductive reasoning system.
~800                        Geber (Jabir ibn Hayyan) develops the Arabic alchemical theory of Takwin, the artificial creation of life in the laboratory, up to and including human life.[6]
13th century                Talking heads were said to have been created, Roger Bacon and Albert the Great reputedly among the owners.
                            Ramon Lull, Spanish theologian, invented machines for discovering nonmathematical truths through combinatorics.
1206                        Al-Jazari created a programmable orchestra of mechanical human beings.[7]
1275                        Ramon Llull, Catalan theologian invents the Ars Magna, a tool for combining concepts mechanically, based on an Arabic astrological tool, the Zairja. The method would be developed further by Gottfried Leibniz in the 17th century.[8]

15th century                Invention of printing using moveable type. Gutenberg Bible printed (1456).

15th-16th century           Clocks, the first modern measuring machines, were first produced using lathes.
16th century                Clockmakers extended their craft to creating mechanical animals and other novelties. For example, see DaVinci's walking lion (1515).
                            Rabbi Loew of Prague is said to have invented the Golem, a clay man brought to life (1580).
~1500                       Paracelsus claimed to have created an artificial man out of magnetism, sperm and alchemy.[9]
~1580                       Rabbi Judah Loew ben Bezalel of Prague is said to have invented the Golem, a clay man brought to life.[10]

Early 17th century          René Descartes proposed that bodies of animals are nothing more than complex machines (but that mental phenomena are of a different &quot;substance&quot;).[11]
17th century                Early in the century, Descartes proposed that bodies of animals are nothing more than complex machines. Many other 17th century thinkers offered variations and elaborations of Cartesian mechanism.
                            Pascal created the first mechanical digital calculating machine (1642).
                            Thomas Hobbes published The Leviathan (1651), containing a mechanistic and combinatorial theory of thinking.
                            Leibniz improved Pascal's machine to do multiplication &amp; division with a machine called the Step Reckoner (1673) and envisioned a universal calculus of reasoning by which arguments could be decided mechanically.
1623                        Wilhelm Schickard created the first mechanical calculating machine.
1641                        Thomas Hobbes published Leviathan and presented a mechanical, combinatorial theory of cognition. He wrote &quot;...for reason is nothing but reckoning&quot;.[12][13]
1652                        Blaise Pascal created the second mechanical and first digital calculating machine[14]
1672                        Gottfried Leibniz improved the earlier machines, making the Stepped Reckoner to do multiplication and division. He also invented the binary numeral system and envisioned a universal calculus of reasoning (alphabet of human thought) by which arguments could be decided mechanically. Leibniz worked on assigning a specific number to each and every object in the world, as a prelude to an algebraic solution to all possible problems.[15]

18th century                The 18th century saw a profusion of mechanical toys, including the celebrated mechanical duck of Vaucanson and von Kempelen's phony mechanical chess player, The Turk (1769). For Edgar Allen Poe's description of the Turk, see Poe Writes about Maelzel's Chess Player April 1836.
1727                        Jonathan Swift published Gulliver's Travels, which includes this description of the Engine, a machine on the island of Laputa: &quot;a Project for improving speculative Knowledge by practical and mechanical Operations &quot; by using this &quot;Contrivance&quot;, &quot;the most ignorant Person at a reasonable Charge, and with a little bodily Labour, may write Books in Philosophy, Poetry, Politicks, Law, Mathematicks, and Theology, with the least Assistance from Genius or study.&quot;[16] The machine is a parody of Ars Magna, one of the inspirations of Gottfried Leibniz' mechanism.
1750                        Julien Offray de La Mettrie published L'Homme Machine, which argued that human thought is strictly mechanical.[17]
1769                        Wolfgang von Kempelen built and toured with his chess-playing automaton, The Turk.[18] The Turk was later shown to be a hoax, involving a human chess player.

19th century                Luddites (led by Ned Ludd) destroyed machinery in England (1811-1816).
                            Mary Shelley published the story of Frankenstein's monster (1818).
                            George Boole developed a binary algebra representing (some) &quot;laws of thought,&quot; published in The Laws of Thought.  
                            Charles Babbage &amp; Ada Byron (Lady Lovelace) designed a programmable mechanical calculating machines. A working model was built in 2002; a short video shows it working.
                            Modern propositional logic developed by Gottlob Frege in his 1879 work Begriffsschrift and later clarified and expanded by Russell, Tarski, Godel, Church and others.
1818                        Mary Shelley published the story of Frankenstein; or the Modern Prometheus, a fictional consideration of the ethics of creating sentient beings.[19]

1854                        George Boole set out to &quot;investigate the fundamental laws of those operations of the mind by which reasoning is performed, to give expression to them in the symbolic language of a calculus&quot;, inventing Boolean algebra.[21]
1863                        Samuel Butler suggested that Darwinian evolution also applies to machines, and speculates that they will one day become conscious and eventually supplant humanity.[22]
1913                        Bertrand Russell and Alfred North Whitehead published Principia Mathematica, which revolutionized formal logic.
1915                        Leonardo Torres y Quevedo built a chess automaton, El Ajedrecista and published speculation about thinking and automata.[23]
1917                        Karel Capek coins the term `robot' (in Czech `robot' means `worker', but the English translation retained the original word).
1923                        Karel Čapek's play R.U.R. (Rossum's Universal Robots) opened in London. This is the first use of the word &quot;robot&quot; in English.[24]

1931                        Kurt Gödel showed that sufficiently powerful consistent formal systems permit the formulation of true theorems that are unprovable by any theorem-proving machine deriving all possible theorems from the axioms. To do this he had to build a universal, integer-based programming language, which is the reason why he is sometimes called the &quot;father of theoretical computer science&quot;.
1941                        Konrad Zuse built the first working program-controlled computers.[25]
1943                        McCulloch and Pitt propose neural-network architectures for intelligence.  
1943                        Warren Sturgis McCulloch and Walter Pitts publish &quot;A Logical Calculus of the Ideas Immanent in Nervous Activity&quot; (1943), laying foundations for artificial neural networks.[26]
1943                        Arturo Rosenblueth, Norbert Wiener and Julian Bigelow coin the term &quot;cybernetics&quot;. Wiener's popular book by that name published in 1948.
1945                        Game theory which would prove invaluable in the progress of AI was introduced with the 1944 paper, Theory of Games and Economic Behavior by mathematician John von Neumann and economist Oskar Morgenstern.
1945                        Vannevar Bush published As We May Think (The Atlantic Monthly, July 1945) a prescient vision of the future in which computers assist humans in many activities.
1948                        John von Neumann (quoted by E.T. Jaynes) in response to a comment at a lecture that it was impossible for a machine to think: &quot;You insist that there is something a machine cannot do. If you will tell me precisely what it is that a machine cannot do, then I can always make a machine which will do just that!&quot;. Von Neumann was presumably alluding to the Church-Turing thesis which states that any effective procedure can be simulated by a (generalized) computer.

1961                        In Minds, Machines and Gödel, John Lucas[31] denied the possibility of machine intelligence on logical or philosophical grounds. He referred to Kurt Gödel's result of 1931: sufficiently powerful formal systems are either inconsistent or allow for formulating true theorems unprovable by any theorem-proving AI deriving all provable theorems from the axioms. Since humans are able to &quot;see&quot; the truth of such theorems, machines were deemed inferior.
