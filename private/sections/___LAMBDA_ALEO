ALEO ZEXE

zexe: high level explanation 
what the kernel space looks like
how an os would enfornce 
but not agoog explanation of what a userpsace would look like

ex. a dex, a stablecoin

this talk is a better explanation

record model used to do private applications
decentralized ledgers come with significanr problems
h
checking by re executing
the intution is for every single xact the nodes have to veriufy
1user submits tx )app, input sig=
2 user broadcast  to network
2
nodes re exeutin computation in tx
3 is computation is corect and si gi valid, state for app is updated

limitarion
1- ledger re exeutaio nhurts calability
  every party mudt re execute each transaction 
 eth 300 nodes mining nodes
 , 5 sec per computation por blokc
 15000 second 4 hours of rexecution
 very wastefull

 can I run it once and jsut be done?

 2 hurts privcu

 core strengh of decen ledger is also primary weakness
 the history if all state stansition mus t be eecute bu all parties

 for normal people not in crupto the position is that if you make a xact you learn nothing about the ot account
 but in you send an address
 in the us its a violation of banking privacy laws
 anyone can see forever

 so how aleo resoves these issues, primarily privacy

 aleo autonomosledger executions offchain
 a decn ledger that enales user to exeute progams off chain and finalize state on chain

 scalabiitt: thousandof transaciton per bloc

privacy xact reeveal no user data for the 
siccingtness act van be calidat in poly (k) time)
transaciton 1kb
verify xact in under 50ms

programs:
	functionality
		extensibility user defined progras
		isolation (malicions programs do not affect honest ones
		inter proces communticaotin (program funcionat can interact))

the account model
- in the account model a decen lege tracks eachg account via global state

to performa a state transcitoin the suer signes a trancastionc add, value, data fee, signature
once its includined inthe block an the global state is updated
