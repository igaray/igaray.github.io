PRODUCTIVITY:

separate your day: a time for producing and creating, a time for consuming and communicating.

"Without great solitude no serious work is possible." - Pablo Picasso

disconnection is the solution
- unplug. unplug network connection, close browser
- have a disconnect time each day
- work somewhere without a connection
- get outside
- leave your mobile device behind
- use blocking software
- disconnect away from work

how to beat connection addiction: break the cycle of positive feedback, replace old habits with new ones
- figure out your triggers: what triggers your habits?
- find a new positive habit to replace each trigger
- try changing each trigger, one at a time
- create positive feedback for the new habit
- create instant negative feedback for the old habit
- repeat the positive feedback cycle as often as possible for the new habit

focus rituals:

- wash hands before touching computer
- breath before programming
- morning quiet
- start of day
- refocus ritual every hour or two
- alternate focus and rest
- alternate two focuses
- end of day

[PROCRASTINATION] is due to the inability to manage negative moods “around” a task : it is a emotion regulation problem not a management time issue => primacy of short term mood repair against long term pursuit of intended action

    [JUST DO IT]: every books start with a phrase, you can always edit/change later
    [FORGIVE UNDERSTAND] : psychologist say forgive yourself while procrastinating - don’t be shameful
    [ANALYSIS => WRITE IT ON PAPER] when wanting to procrastinate: analyse self = what instant emotions? sometimes just doing the first step as if I was starting to do the procrastinating action is sufficent => want to go back to long term goal a few seconds after
    [NEXT ACTION]: think/consider what is/could be the next action (similar to write down, break into pieces)
