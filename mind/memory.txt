# Ten ways to improve memory

1 Be intentional in remembering

Intetion has a lot to do with retention
When one tries to rememeber, retention improves ~20% for a few hours.
For longer periods of time, by as much as 60%

2 Memorize the new through the old

3 Cultivate a broad range of interests

4 Talk over the things you want to remember

reinforce memories by talking about them
one remembers 15% more after memorizing things that are heard as well as seen
writing things down reinforces memory but stronger memories have been found to result from repeating and talking about the things to remember

5 Revive your recent memories

i.e. spaced repetition

one forgets most rapidly immediately after memorizing
the first day after memorizing one forgets more than one will forget the next thirty days unless one refreshes one's memory in the meantime
the principal method to use in order to avoid rapid loss is to brush up soon after having memorized
if you read an interesting articles, the time to brush up is within half a day after the first impression has been made
take advantage of your spare moments by reviving recent memories
at the end of the day make a recap
recall worthwhile things you have seen, heard or read.

6 Repeat what you want to remember

you can improve the strength of memories by repeating them twice
repetition alone is not the most desireable memory aid, the contents should be understood

7 Memorize meanings

you can remember quicker when you look for meaning
you can also remember longer when you remember sense
use dictionaries to expand vocabulary and gain new word meanings
if a word is not clear to you, look it up
read papers and magazines for meanings rather than words
when reading, try to put the meaning in your own words

8 Memorize early in the day

one can memorize ideas best in the forenoon, from eight to ten in the morning, for those waking up at 7
probably because of less fatigue and less new impressions in the nervous system

9 Approach memorization with a positive attitude

one's mental efficacy is improved when one approaches work with a positive attitude
if you cannot genuinely change your inner attitude, merely faking an attitude of pleasure will also help

10 Make overmemorizing a habit
