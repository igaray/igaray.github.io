## Why do you need a motivation hack anyway?

If you’re looking for a motivation hack, that means there’s something you
feel you HAVE TO do, or SHOULD DO, but you don’t feel like doing it.

It holds the key to motivation.

When I was a kid I used to jump out of bed at 6 am on the weekend, all excited.
Because the morning cartoons were on! And yet during weekdays, I would be hard
pressed to drag myself out of bed by 7:30.

During the week, I HAD TO get up. On the weekend, I WANTED TO get up!

So if you’re looking for a motivation hack, that means you don’t really WANT TO
do something. You logically know you SHOULD be doing it, but your emotions tell
you otherwise. You associate pain with doing it.

But first, there’s one more thing you need to understand. Bribing yourself is
directly COUNTER-PRODUCTIVE as far as motivation goes!

## Why bribing yourself doesn’t work:

Let’s say you have some writing that you want to get finished. But you don’t
feel like doing it. So what would most people immediately do? Bribe themselves!
They decide to stick it out, and then reward themselves with a cold beer or a
chocolate bar or any other kind of reward.

That absolutely KILLS motivation in the long term!

“But it works!”

Well, yes and no. Bribing yourself might get the task done this time. But it
also associates even more pain to doing the task, because you now see it as
this annoying painful thing you need to get through to get your reward. The
next time you want to do the same task, it will be even harder to get
motivated.

Through bribing, you don’t get yourself to the point where you WANT to do
something. You only reinforce the notion that it’s something you HAVE TO suffer
through to get a reward.

Remember when I told you it’s all about what you WANT TO do vs. what you
HAVE TO do? Remember it every time you struggle with motivation.

## The Ultimate Motivation Hack

You want to get to the point where you WANT TO do the task.

The best way I found was… to make the task itself FUN!

Don’t take yourself too seriously. In fact, making a fool of yourself is a
great way to start enjoying the task again.

A couple of months back, I started really strugging with writing. It became a
painful chore, and I even thought of quitting blogging. But when I stopped
myself and thought deeply about the problem, I realized I simply started taking
myself too seriously! I had built up a readership, and I started caring about
what they thought. (As in, “What would they think of me if I wrote this silly
stuff?”)

Then I realized it doesn’t matter. If somebody doesn’t like my writing style,
they’re free to stop reading. Being myself is more important than impressing
strangers. And once I realized that, and stop censoring myself, the floodgates
opened! Writing became easy again, because I was having FUN while doing it!
(Plus, I got a lot more positive responses from readers!)

So if you want to build a motivation hack for yourself, just remember:
It’s about making the task FUN.

You can make it more challenging, or more silly, or more ridiculous (I had a
friend in high school who hated how formal the essays had to be. One day he
decided to instead make it AS FORMAL AS POSSIBLE, using incredibly long
convoluted sentences and fancy words, to see if the teacher caught on to the
irony. She never did…)

I’m not going to give you “the one hack”. Because no one technique works for
every person in every situation.

Instead, I will let YOU create hacks that work for YOU in each particular
situation! Based on the principles I shared in this post, you can create your
own motivation hack for every situation. And THAT is the Ultimate Motivation
Hack.

## Self-determination

- http://www.selfdeterminationtheory.org/theory

Self-Determination Theory (SDT) is a theory of motivation. It is concerned with
supporting our natural or intrinsic tendencies to behave in effective and
healthy ways. SDT has been researched and practiced by a network of researchers
around the world.

Like most people there are parts of my job I don’t enjoy. Writing quotes, for
example, is not my favourite activity. Recently I’ve been thinking about a way
to “hack” my motivation, to make these parts of my job more interesting and
enjoyable.

Self-determination theory posits that motivation derives from autonomy,
relatedness, and competency. The first two are easy to come by in a small
business. I’m my own boss and what I do is critical to the success of the
business, and hence to my continued mortgage payments. So it seems the later is
the limiting factor. This matches my experience; I can happily program for
hours (days? years?) and I consider my pretty damn good at it. Writing quotes
is painful and it takes me a long time to finish one. So perhaps if I can gain
competency I’ll enjoy writing quotes more and thus become more motivated to
complete them.

How does one gain competency? Deliberate practice is how. It may take 10000
hours to become an expert but I don’t need to be an expert quote writer, just a
better one than I am today. Luckily the learning curve suggests that I can get
to a good level of competency with relatively little effort. So this is my hack
for improving motivation: pick something I do often that I’m bad at and practice
it in a fun way. For quote writing that might mean trying to write a good quote
for a preposterous imagined product. If you enjoy the ridiculous like I do you’d
probably find that fun.

I’m not actually going to practice quote writing right now as I have other big
projects occupying me, but I intend to try this technique out in the future.
I’ll let you all know how this turns out for me. Finally, if you try my
technique I’d love to hear how it works out for you.

### Overview

People are centrally concerned with motivation -- how to move themselves or
others to act. Everywhere, parents, teachers, coaches, and managers struggle
with how to motivate those that they mentor, and individuals struggle to find
energy, mobilize effort and persist at the tasks of life and work.  People are
often moved by external factors such as reward systems, grades, evaluations, or
the opinions they fear others might have of them.  Yet just as frequently,
people are motivated from within, by interests, curiosity, care or abiding
values.  These intrinsic motivations are not necessarily externally rewarded or
supported, but nonetheless they can sustain passions, creativity, and sustained
efforts. The interplay between the extrinsic forces acting on persons and the
intrinsic motives and needs inherent in human nature is the territory of
Self-Determination Theory.

Self-Determination Theory (SDT) represents a broad framework for the study of
human motivation and personality. SDT articulates a meta-theory for framing
motivational studies, a formal theory that defines intrinsic and varied
extrinsic sources of motivation, and a description of the respective roles of
intrinsic and types of extrinsic motivation in cognitive and social development
and in individual differences. Perhaps more importantly SDT propositions also
focus on how social and cultural factors facilitate or undermine people’s sense
of volition and initiative, in addition to their well-being and the quality of
their performance.  Conditions supporting the individual’s experience of
autonomy, competence, and relatedness are argued to foster the most volitional
and high quality forms of motivation and engagement for activities, including
enhanced performance, persistence, and creativity. In addition SDT proposes
that the degree to which any of these three psychological needs is unsupported
or thwarted within a social context will have a robust detrimental impact on
wellness in that setting.

The dynamics of psychological need support and need thwarting have been studied
within families, classrooms, teams, organizations, clinics, and cultures using
specific propositions detailed within SDT. The SDT framework thus has both
broad and behavior-specific implications for understanding practices and
structures that enhance versus diminish need satisfaction and the full
functioning that follows from it. These many implications are best revealed by
the varied papers listed on this website, which range from basic research on
motivational micro-processes to applied clinical trials aiming at population
outcomes.

### Meta-Theory: The Organismic Viewpoint

SDT is an organismic dialectical approach. It begins with the assumption that
people are active organisms, with evolved tendencies toward growing, mastering
ambient challenges, and integrating new experiences into a coherent sense of
self. These natural developmental tendencies do not, however, operate
automatically, but instead require ongoing social nutriments and supports. That
is, the social context can either support or thwart the natural tendencies
toward active engagement and psychological growth, or it can catalyze lack of
integration, defense, and fulfillment of need-substitutes. Thus, it is the
dialectic between the active organism and the social context that is the basis
for SDT's predictions about behavior, experience, and development.

Within SDT, the nutriments for healthy development and functioning are
specified using the concept of basic psychological needs for autonomy,
competence, and relatedness. To the extent that the needs are ongoingly
satisfied people will develop and function effectively and experience wellness,
but to the extent that they are thwarted, people more likely evidence ill-being
and non-optimal functioning. The darker sides of human behavior and experience,
such as certain types of psychopathology, prejudice, and aggression are
understood in terms of reactions to basic needs having been thwarted, either
developmentally or proximally.

### Formal Theory: SDT’s 5 Mini-Theories

Formally SDT comprises five mini-theories, each of which was developed to
explain a set of motivationally based phenomena that emerged from laboratory
and field research. Each, therefore, addresses one facet of motivation or
personality functioning.

Cognitive Evaluation Theory (CET) concerns intrinsic motivation, motivation
that is based on the satisfactions of behaving “for its own sake.” Prototypes
of intrinsic motivation are children’s exploration and play, but intrinsic
motivation is a lifelong creative wellspring.  CET specifically addresses the
effects of social contexts on intrinsic motivation, or how factors such as
rewards, interpersonal controls, and ego-involvements impact intrinsic
motivation and interest. CET highlights the critical roles played by competence
and autonomy supports in fostering intrinsic motivation, which is critical in
education, arts, sport, and many other domains.

The second mini-theory, Organismic Integration Theory (OIT), addresses the
topic of extrinsic motivation in its various forms, with their properties,
determinants, and consequences. Broadly speaking extrinsic motivation is
behavior that is instrumental—that aims toward outcomes extrinsic to the
behavior itself. Yet there are distinct forms of instrumentality, which include
external regulation, introjection, identification, and integration. These
subtypes of extrinsic motivation are seen as falling along a continuum of
internalization. The more internalized the extrinsic motivation the more
autonomous the person will be when enacting the behaviors. OIT is further
concerned with social contexts that enhance or forestall internalization—that
is, with what conduces toward people either resisting, partially adopting, or
deeply internalizing values, goals, or belief systems. OIT particularly
highlights supports for autonomy and relatedness as critical to
internalization.

Causality Orientations Theory (COT), the third mini-theory, describes
individual differences in people's tendencies to orient toward environments and
regulate behavior in various ways. COT describes and assesses three types of
causality orientations: the autonomy orientation in which persons act out of
interest in and valuing of what is occurring; the control orientation in which
the focus is on rewards, gains, and approval; and the impersonal or amotivated
orientation characterized by anxiety concerning competence.

Fourth, Basic Psychological Needs Theory (BPNT) elaborates the concept of
evolved psychological needs and their relations to psychological health and
well-being. BPNT argues that psychological well-being and optimal functioning
is predicated on autonomy, competence, and relatedness. Therefore, contexts
that support versus thwart these needs should invariantly impact wellness. The
theory argues that all three needs are essential and that if any is thwarted
there will be distinct functional costs. Because basic needs are universal
aspects of functioning, BPNT looks at cross-developmental and cross-cultural
settings for validation and refinements.

The fifth mini-theory, Goal Contents Theory (GCT), grows out of the
distinctions between intrinsic and extrinsic goals and their impact on
motivation and wellness. Goals are seen as differentially affording basic need
satisfactions and are thus differentially associated with well-being. Extrinsic
goals such as financial success, appearance, and popularity/fame have been
specifically contrasted with intrinsic goals such as community, close
relationships, and personal growth, with the former more likely associated with
lower wellness and greater ill-being.

### Other Topics of Interest

As SDT has expanded both in terms of breadth and depth, both theoretical
developments and empirical findings have led SDT researchers to examine a
plethora of processes and phenomena integral to personality growth, effective
functioning, and wellness. For example, SDT research has focused on the role of
mindfulness as a foundation for autonomous regulation of behavior, leading to
both refined measurement and theorizing about awareness.  The study of
facilitating conditions for intrinsic motivation led to a theory and
measurement strategy regarding vitality, an indicator of both mental and
physical wellness. Work on vitality also uncovered the remarkable positive
impact of the experience of nature on well-being.  Some research within SDT has
more closely examined the forms personal passions can take, with individuals
being obsessive or harmonious as a function of internalization processes. And
cross-cultural tests of SDT have led to an increased understanding of how
economic and cultural forms impact the invariant aspects of human nature.
Research on wellness has also led to new theory and research on the assessment
of well-being itself, including the distinction between hedonic and eudaimonic
forms of living.  Specific topics such as autonomy versus controlled motivation
has led to greater understanding of internalized control such as
ego-involvement and contingent self-esteem and of the differences between them
and autonomous self-regulation. Indeed these few examples supply just a taste
of how the generative framework of SDT has enhanced research on a variety of
processes of interest to the field

### Applications

In addition to formal theory development, research has applied SDT in many
domains including education, organizations, sport and physical activity,
religion, health and medicine, parenting, virtual environments and media, close
relationships, and psychotherapy. Across these domains research has looked at
how controlling versus autonomy-supportive environments impact functioning and
wellness, as well as performance and persistence.  In addition, supports for
relatedness and competence are seen as interactive with volitional supports in
fostering engagement and value within specific settings, and within domains of
activity. This body of applied research has led to considerable specification
of techniques, including goal structures and ways of communicating that have
proven effective at promoting maintained, volitional motivation.

The varied articles on this website demonstrate the many types of inquiry
associated with the SDT framework, as well as its generative capacity with
respect to practical issues in human organizations of all kinds. Relevant
research reports and theoretical discussion are listed in the Publications
section, organized by topic.

By focusing on the fundamental psychological tendencies toward intrinsic
motivation and integration, SDT occupies a unique position in psychology, as it
addresses not only the central questions of why people do what they do, but
also the costs and benefits of various ways of socially regulating or promoting
behavior. Overviews of the theory can be found in Ryan and Deci (2000) and in
Deci and Ryan (1985, 2000), as well as numerousother articles and chapters
identified on this website.

## Vision and Self-Motivation

Without it, nothing else works.
Without it, nothing else matters.

Success secret 1: self motivation
"you miss 100 % of the shots you don't take"
So much of what great athletes do to accomplish the impossible is through visualization.
Desire has absolutely nothing to do with motivation.
Success:  moving forward toward what you want,  being in the process of achievement, and being in love with the process.
Sucess is not getting everything you ever wanted.

the key to motivation:
- enthusiasm
- courage
- persistence
- creativity

Restlessness is discontent, and discontent is the first sign of progress.

Vision creates self motivation.
motivation pours forth to the degree there is a contrast between how we are performing and how we imagine ourselves performing.
to the degree that there is a contrast between what we have decided should be happening (visions) and what is happening (current results), motivation naturally, effortlessly, powerfully and infinitely flows.

A vision, for the purpose of creating motivation, is the same as an expectation, a belief or a mindset.
A vision is simply how we see ourselves, the conversation we have with ourselves  and the way we feel about ourselves in any given endeavor.

How do you create a vision?
It is not a matter of getting one, it's a matter of replacing the one you have with one that propels you towards your goals.


MAP OUT YOUR GOALS

the power of goal setting:
most people confuse goal setting with desire
people think that if you write down all the things that you desire, that's goal setting, it's not
goal setting only works when your goal becomes your mindset
goals have to become beliefs and expectations
you have to believe what you want is actually inevitable

i expected to fail, that was my unconscious goal, and I achieved it again and again
take charge of your negative thoughts as they appear, and consciously evict them
your beliefs will change, and you will expect success

most people’s visions are based solely on what they have been experiencing
experience, for most of us, is "the truth" and we bind ourselves to that truth

SUCCESS: progressing on your chosen path and being in love with the process

The decisions you have made about yourself create the picture you held in your mind
your decisions are created by the input you've received, which comes to you as conversations or experiences
this conversation originates from one or all of the following:
- outside input, such as what people have told you
- experiences you've had, the "facts"
- your internal dialogue, your own conscious mind chatter

the problem with our "computer" is that we let just about everyone weve ever met program it!
worse yes, we let ourselves program it, and we usually don't know the first thing about how to write functional programs, much less the elegant ones that create the motivation to lead us to break through our barriers to success

other people’s input:
    one major source of our beliefs of what is expected of us was formed by input from outside influences
    the more respected and admired the source, the more quickly we adopted that input as "true" and believed it unquestionably

experience:
    a second powerful source of beliefs comes from your past experiences
    there is a way to use only the good and replace the bad

self-talk:
    the third comes from your thoughts and feelings you tell yourself about your own experiences, and what you've told yourself about the input you receieved from other people
    the reason our rerun conversations and self talk have such a powerful effect is due to one of the most profound statements we can make about the human mind
    it's truly the most useful gift given to mankind

    TO THE DEGREE THERE IS CLARITY, THE MIND DOES NOT DISTINGUISH BETWEEN AN ACTUAL EXPERIENCE AND ONE THAT HAS BEEN VIVIDLY IMAGINED!

The truth that makes men free is, for the most part, the truth which men prefer not to hear.

even a real experience is no more that a perception of your mind
you have an experience and you have a perception of that experience
your thoughts and feelings are the vision of that that experience was for you

here's the key: you MAKE UP what happened by the thoughts and feelings you have about your experience
think for a moment of that particular event that happened to you a long time ago, something stupid or embarrassing.
it may have happened only once but you relieved it many times
every time you relive that event, it has the same impact on you as the very first time it happened, and the exact same quality

WE MAKE IT ALL UP!!!

none of it is true
the script you are working from has nothing to do with the truth
the only real truth is that you made it all up!

The Art of Deciding: Convenience or Commitment

In our developmental years we form our personality.
These years encompass prenatal through about age 5.
During these years, without the vast background of context and reason we have as adults, we tend to experience events and 'decide' who we are versus deciding what happened.

These type of decision is not like the ones we make today.
Nor is it a commitment to anything.
It is a potentially permanent decision about who you are.

Out of these decision we form a personality either to keep those decisions in place or actually rebel against them.
The art of deciding requires some distinctions:

- a decision of who you are: is an emotional decision made one time, that in most is permanent for life. we make many of these by age 5, and others in key moments in our lives when we are most vulnerable or in a moment of epiphany.
- a decision of convenience: we make these kind of decisions all the time, something happens, and we make a decision to do something or even perhaps to become somebody more than we really are. we make these decision "because they seem like a good idea at the time". in the moment, it feels right and easy. most decisions in life are made this way, and they produce little or nothing
- a decision to commit: is the kind of decision that produces results and permanent change. it is a decision the quality of which has long-term forward thinking to back it. it has esolve, it has a sense of "zero tolerance" for the current state of affairs.

a decision to commit involves the distinction of commitment, which is a decision to do something NO MATTER WHAT
a commitment is a decision to do something to be something no matter the obstacles, no matter whether you still feel like it next week, no matter how hard it gets, no matter how many times you fail, no matter what results you are creating.
a commitment pays no attention to the outcome, other than to refine strategy, results do not alter the commitment to persevere

so how do we make a commitment? sometimes, especially when we cannot tolerate ourselves any more, and sometimes when just the right mix of incentives floats by, we can make a commitment instantaneously
waiting for either circumstance is a perilous game

the art of making commitments is a character trait we can choose to practice
we make a commitement with the full and conscious intention of bringing it to fruition
and we keep making that commitment as often as we need to, until it takes a course of its own or becomes part of us, habitual

the most powerful place to use commitement is to change what you believe about you, to free up your spirit by letting go of a personality formed by an angry or disappointed 3 year old
yo ucan decide you are someone different
we can decide that because we have more to bring to the conversation than a 3 year old

THE NEW SCREENPLAY

we made up all the beliefs we have about ourselveswe made something up based on what happened or what we thought happened or what someone told us happened
and then we went about learning to believe in those stories by listening to them over and over again
so how do we break through?
first...

WE GIVE UP OUR RIGHT TO BE RIGHT ABOUT US
    most of us hold on to what we believe to be true, about life and everything else, as if there were no possibilities for any other truth
    breaking through your barriers to success requires that you make up new ideas of what's possible, so that your possibilities support an empower your desires

        +-----> VISION -----+
        |                   v
    EXPERIENCE          ACTIONS
        ^                   |
        +-------RESULTS<----+

        we must start in vision to break the cycle

we have the extraordinary ability to create thoughts at will, and we can imprint those thoughts on and into our minds at will, as often as we choose
to the degree that our picture has clarity and detail, and can be expressed and experienced by our senses and emotions, our mind will respond to it as if it is a real experience
the richer and more complete the image, the greater its impact in and on your mind

YOU DECIDE TO CHANGE YOUR MIND.
YOU CHANGE YOUR MIND WHENEVER YOU WANT TO.

TO THE DEGREE THERE IS CLARITY, THE MIND DOES NOT DISTINGUISH BETWEEN AN ACTUAL EXPERIENCE AND ONE THAT HAS BEEN VIVIDLY IMAGINED.

WHO ARE YOU TO PLAY SMALL?

The reasonable man adapts himself to the world. The unreasonable one persists in trying to adapt the world to himself. Therefore, all progress depends on the unreasonable man.

Our deepest fear is not that we are inadequate.
Our deepest fear is that we are powerful beyond measure.
It is ourlight, not our darkness that most frightens us.
Your playing small does not serve the world.
There is nothing enlightened about shrinking so that other people won't feel insecure about you.

What the mind of man can concieve and believe, it can achieve.

Most of us have been taught to pursue by indentifying what we want to do.
Our tendency is to go directly for those things and the money that will provide them.
And yet, our greatest point of leverage to achieve anything and everything we want is not what we have, but who we are
It is who we are, and we are being in the moment, that creates the tangible results in our lives.

People who are broke or sick or friendless are so because of who they are being.
What they have done to create these results is simply an effect that follows that cause.
The most powerful visions therefore are those that redefine who you are, envisioning a person who does deserve happiness, health and wealth.

How do you know know what your vision is?
The secret to motivation is a crystal clear vision that is aligned with your goals, your true values, gifts and life purpose.

A vision that empowers us will reflect our true values and our natural gifts.

To create a vision of who you would love to become, access these four cornerstones:

I   Your athentic values are:
    * acceptance        * honesty       * perfection
    * appreciation      * humor         * pleasure
    * belonging         * independence  * power
    * comfort           * integrity     * recognition
    * intimacy          * relationships * joy
    * respect           * creativity    * love
    * safety            * family        * order
    * security          * freedom       * partnership
    * fun               * trust         * harmony
    * peace             * work          * participation
    * spirituality      * communication * contribution
Values are simply those things in life that are important to you.

II  Gifts
Each of us has one or more natural gifts or talents that are contributions to other people.
You may be in denial about yours, but jsut ask anyone who knows you well.
    * Challenge         * Honesty       * Love
    * Contribution      * Inspiration   * Music
    * Creativity        * Integrity     * Spirituality
    * Friendship        * Joy           * Strength
    * Fun               * Leadership    * Success

III Life purpose
life purpose is often confused with grandiose achievements
although these may be authentic life purposes for somebody, for most of us the theme of our lives is much simpler
e.g. raising a successful family, being a role model for the community, inspiring others to succeed

IV  Character traits, beliefs and habits
Make a list of th ten most desired character traits, beliefs and habits that you will need to develop to beome the person that attracts what you want
e.g * I act quickly on things I need to do
    * I look for the positive and good in everyone
    * I respect and take care of my body
    * I deserve to be successful
    * I play a little or a lot everyday

Affirmations:
are statements of specific goals phrased as factsthey are a way to simplify your vision and break it into simple one-liners that can shape the way you see the world and the way you see yourself "being" in it
* I am in action everyday           * I love vigorous exercise
* I love supporting people          * I get things done anyway
* I am healthy and vital
* I have freedom
* I believe in me
* I know success is inevitable
* Life is function

Seeing is believing
Look at your actions in the areas of your life where you know you have visions
your visions need to be aligned with what you want
are they? look at your actions

Any vision can become real to you just by following the screenwriter's model, expressed in three questions:
1 what exactly is happening?
2 What exactly are people saying and how are they saying?
3 How are you feeling?

With that captured, simply write the screenplay of your life
1 write a film script in exact detail
2 write is as though it is happening NOW
3 write it in the first person
4 specifically write:
    - what you are doing        - what others are doing
    - what you are saying       - what others are saying
    - what you are feeling      - what others are feeling
5 Avoid any words labeling what you dont want
6 Secure pictures that help tell the story

As you visualize, see, hear, sense and especially feel just the way you would as if you were actually living the experience here and now.
As your new vision takes hold, your mindset will elevate, creating that subtle yet powerful motivation which will positively impact all your actions and behavior.
Your performance in nearly every area of your life and work will change for the better.

How to make your film script - your vision
1 read your vision first thing in the morning and last thing at night
2 as you read and look at your pictures, pause, close your eyes, and visualize yourself experiencing your vision
3 allow yourself to feel how you will feel, simply watch your movie
4 do this for thirty days straight and your life will change dramatically

Wordsmithing your Vision
1 all phrases are positive
2 all phrases are present tense
3 phrases describing you are written in the first person, I or we
4 clarity gives the vision power, give the details of your vision
5 emotions, tone and energy provide clarity, write about the emotions, the tone and the energy

it only takes a moment to motivate
- write about a small space in time when you have accomplished your goals
- write about a moment when you are feeling the most powerful feelings of success

another key is to keep it positive


The Invitation
It doesn't interest me what you do for a living.
I want to know what you ache for, and if you dare to dream of meeting your heart's longing.

It doesn't interest me how old you are.
I want to know if you will risk looking like a fool for love, for your dreams, for the adventure of being alive.

It doesn't interest me what planets are squaring your moon.
I want to know if you have touched the center of your own sorrow, if you have been opened by life's betrayals, or have become shriveled and closed from fear of further pain.
I want to know if you can sit with pain, mine or your own, without moving to hide it or fake it or fix it.
I want to know if you can be with joy, mine or your own, if you can dance with wildness and let ecstasy fill you to the tips of your fingers and toes without cautioning us to be careful, be realistic, or to remember the limitations of being human.

It doesn't interest me if the story you are telling is true.
I want to know if you can disappoint another to be true to yourself, if you can bear the accusation of betrayal, and not betray your own soul.
I want to know if you can see beauty even if it's not pretty every day, and if yo ucan wellspring your life from a sacred presence.
I want to know if you can live with failure, yours and mine, and still stand on the edge of a lake and shout to the silver of the full moon... YES!

It doesn't interest me to know where you live or how much money you have.
I want to know if you can get up after a night of grief and despair, weary and bruised to the bone, and do what needs to be done for the children.

It doesn't interest me who you know, or how you came to be here.
I want to know if you will stand in the center of the fire with me and not shrink back.

It doesn't interest me where, or with whom, you have studied.
I want to know what sustains you from the inside, when all else falls away.
I want to know if you can be alone with yourself, and if you truly like the company you keep in the empty moments...

- Oriah Mountain Dreamer - Native American Dreamer

This, therefore, is a faded dream of the time when I went down into the dust and noise of the eastern marketplace, with my brain and muscles, with sweat and constant thinking, mad others see my visions coming true.
Those who dream by night in the dusty recesses of their minds wake in the day to find that all was vanity, but the dreamers of the day are dangerous men, for they may act their dream with open eyes, and make it possible.

Carefully watch  your thoughts, for they become your words.
Manage and watch your words, for they will become your actions.
Consider and judge your actions, for they have become your habits.
Acknowledge and watch your habits, for they shall become your values.
Understand and embrace your values, for they  become your destiny.

Amidst the glut of insignificance that engulfs us all, the temptation is understandable to
stop thinking.  The trouble is that unthinking persons cannot choose, but must let others
choose for them. To fail to make one’s own choices is to betray the freedom which is
our society’s greatest gift to all of us.

l. BE IMPECCABLE WITH YOUR WORD.
Speak with integrity. Say only what you mean. Avoid using the word to speak
against yourself or to gossip about others. Use the power of your word in the direc -
tion of truth and love.

2. DON’T TAKE ANYTHING PERSONALLY.
Nothing others do is because of you. What others say and do is a projection of
their own reality, their own dream. When you are immune to the opinions and
actions of others, you won’t be the victim of needless suffering.
3. DON’T MAKE ASSUMPTIONS.
Find the courage to ask questions and to express what you really want.  Communicate
with others as clearly as you can to avoid misunderstandings, sadness and drama.
With just this one agreement, you can completely transform your life.

4. ALWAYS DO YOUR BEST.
Your best is going to change from moment to moment; it will be different when you
are healthy, as opposed to sick. Under any circumstance, simply do your best, and
you will avoid self-judgment, self-abuse and regret.

All I Ever Really Needed to Know I Learned in Kindergarten
Share everything.
Play fair.
Don’t hit people.
Put things back where you found them.
Clean up your own mess.
Don’t take things that aren’t yours.
Say sorry when you hurt somebody.
Wash your hands before you eat.
Flush.
Warm cookies and cold milk are good for you.
Live a balanced life.
Learn some and think some and draw and paint and sing and dance and play
and work every day some.
Take a nap every afternoon.
When you go out into the world, watch for traffic, hold hands, and stick
together.
Be aware of wonder. Remember the little seed in the plastic cup? The roots
go down and the plant goes up and nobody really knows how or why, but
we are all like that.
Goldfish and hamsters and white mice and even the little seed in the plastic
cup — they all die. So do we.
And then remember the book about Dick and Jane and the first word you
learned, the biggest word of all: LOOK.
Everything you need to know is in there somewhere.
The Golden Rule and love and basic sanitation.
Ecology and politics and sane living.
Think of what a better world it would be if we all — the whole world had
cookies and milk about 3 o’clock every afternoon and then lay down with
our blankets for a nap. Or if we had a basic policy in our nation and other
nations to always put things back where we found them and cleaned up our
own messes. And it is still true, no matter how old you are, when you go
out into the world, it is best to hold hands and stick together.

A midlife crisis is when you’ve reached the top rung of your ladder only to realize
that you’ve leaned it against the wrong wall.
—Author Unknown

It is not because things are difficult that we do not dare, it is because we do not
dare that things are difficult.
—Seneca, 5BC-65AD
Ro man  Philosopher

Security is mostly superstition. It does not exist in nature. Nor do the children of
men as a whole experience it. Avoiding danger is no safer in the long run than out -
right exposure. Life is either a daring adventure or nothing at all.
—Helen Keller,  1880-1968
The Open Door


Promise yourself...
To be so strong that nothing can disturb your peace of mind.
To talk health, happiness and prosperity to every person you meet.
To make all your friends feels that there is something to them.
To look at the sunny side of everything and make your optimism come true.
To think only the best, to work for the best and expect only the best.
To be just as enthusiastic about the success of others as you are about your own.
To forget the mistakes of the past and press on to the greater achievements of
the future.
To wear a cheerful countenance at all times and to give every living creature
you meet a smile.
To give so much time to the improvement of yourself that you have no time to
criticize others.
To be too large for worry, too noble for anger, too strong for fear and too
happy to permit the presence of trouble.

—Christian D. Larson
THE OPTIMIST CREED

The tragedy of life is not death, but what dies inside us while we live....
— Norman Cousins,  1915-1990

No problem can stand the assault of sustained thinking.
— Voltaire (François-Marie Arouet),  1694-1778
