So, this guy is going through a mid-life crisis, and he decides that he's going
to buy a motorcycle. He flips through one of the local circulars, and finds a 20
year old motorcycle for sale for $2,000. It's pretty close to his home, so he
goes over and checks it out.
The bike is in the driveway, and it's in cherry condition. Original chrome,
saddle bags, all original parts and body... and the owner is outside, sitting
down. They get to talking.
"Well, why are you selling it?
"Almost got into an accident, and with my wife pregnant, she said it had to go.
"So, I'm just looking for some quick cash.
"All original?
"Yup.
"How'd you keep it from rusting all of these years?
"Well, you'll think it's funny, but it's true. Whenever it's about to rain, I
"put vaseline on the chrome, keeps the moisture out.
The guy thinks that's pretty clever, inspects the bike some more, decides he's
going to buy it.
"Great, the seller says. Hey, you know, in one of the saddle bags, there's the
"vaseline. Just keep it.
Riding it home, he sees his girlfriend waiting for him. He talks about the bike.
She loves it, says "Hey, listen, we're going over my parents house for dinner."
"Uh, ok, he says. He's never met the parents.
"But listen. You can't say anything.
"What?
"Yeah. If you say anything, anything at all, you have to do the dishes.
"The... yeah, ok, he says, thinking it's a joke.
So, they take the bike over to her folks. It's clouding up, so he takes the
vaseline with him, and when they get to the door the parents are there, ushering
them inside.
And there are dirty dishes everywhere. Up the stairs, piled on couches, on the
tv... everywhere.
This is fucking weird, he thinks, but he goes, sits down at the kitchen table.
Food's ready, everyone's eating, no one is saying a word. Not a word.
He's watching everyone and thinks, this is crazy, I have to do something. So he
picks up his girlfriend, throws her on the kitchen table, fucks her right there.
No one says anything.
They both go back to eating. He's thinking, this is just bananas. Grabs the
mother, throws her on the kitchen table, fucks her right there.
No one says a single thing.
They both sit back down, and he's just beside himself. This is truly unreal, he
thinks. He goes back to eating.
After a moment, he looks outside and sees that it's starting to drizzle. So he
reaches into his bag and grabs the jar of vaseline and the father says "FINE,
GODDAMMIT, I'LL DO THE DISHES!"

A man walks into a bar with a pet monkey.

He orders a drink, and while he's drinking, the monkey jumps all over the place,
eating everything behind the bar. Then the monkey jumps on to the pool table and
swallows a billiard ball.

The bartender screams at the guy, "Your monkey just ate the cue ball off my pool
table -- whole!"

"Sorry, replied the guy. He eats everything in sight, the little bastard. I'll
"pay for everything.

The man finishes his drink, pays and leaves.

Two weeks later, he's in the bar with his pet monkey, again. He orders a drink,
and the monkey starts running around the bar. The monkey finds a maraschino
cherry on the bar. He grabs it, sticks it up his ass, pulls it out and eats it.

The bartender is disgusted. "Did you see what your monkey did now?" he asks.

"Yeah, replies the guy. He still eats everything in sight, but ever since he
"swallowed that cue ball, he measures stuff first.

A 92 year old man went to his doctor after proposing to his girlfriend.

Old man: Doc, I'm getting married soon and I want a vasectomy.

Doctor: Well, how old is the bride to be?

Old man: She's quite a bit younger than me. She's 68.

Doctor: Well I don't think you need a vasectomy, the chances of her getting
pregnant are very slim.

Old man: Well, we are both in a position where we can't take care of a child, so
it's a chance that I cannot afford to take.

Doctor: I understand your concern, but... let's not be too hasty and let's get a
sperm sample first, take this cup and come back when you get a sample.

The old man agrees and a week later comes back to the doctors office. And
defiantly sets the empty cup on the table.

Doctor: Well I see that you couldn't give me a sample, that's good news.

Old man: Well let me tell you what happened. You see I grab the cup and I start
trying with my right hand... nothing. Then I try with my left and nothing.

Doctor: I see

Old man: Then I ask my sweet heart for help and she starts trying with her right
hand and nothing, then with her left and nothing. She even tries with her teeth
in, teeth out, nothing. We just couldn't get the lid off that darn cup.

A man walked into the produce section of his local supermarket and asked to buy
half a head of lettuce. The boy working in that department told him that they
only sold whole heads of lettuce.

The man was insistent that the boy ask his manager about the matter. Walking
into the back room, the boy said to his manager, "Some asshole wants to buy a
half a head of lettuce."

As he finished his sentence, he turned to find the man standing right behind
him, so he added, "and this gentleman kindly offered to buy the other half."

The manager approved the deal and the man went on his way. Later the manager
found the boy and said, "I was impressed with the way you got yourself out of
that situation earlier. We like people who think on their feet here. Where are
you from, son?"

"Canada, sir, the boy replied.

"Well, why did you leave Canada? the manager asked.

The boy said, "Sir, there's nothing but whores and hockey players up there."

"Really! said the manager. My wife is from Canada!

The boy replied, "No shit‽‽‽‽ Who did she play for?"

A secret agency was looking for a new agent. They narrowed down their choices
between three men. These three men had gone through all the training and passed
all the tests the agency could throw at them with flying colors. But all three
of them knew that the agency was only looking to hire one of them. They came to
their last test. They were standing in a small room each facing their own
separate doors. The test coordinator behind them said, "Your last test is to see
if you have what it takes to take someones life. You will walk into the room in
front of you and close the door behind you. There will be a gun sitting on a
desk and behind the desk there will be person tied to a chair. Without
hesitation you must take aim and pull the trigger, killing the bounded person.".
The first agent went in, shut the door, and there was silence. After a few
seconds he opened the door and left the room. He said, "I am sorry I can't do
it. I can't shoot my own wife" He stormed out of the training room immediately.
The second agent went in closing the door behind him. No noises came from the
room except for sobs. He returned and said, "I just cant take my wife's life
like that. She has given me so much in this world I just can't do it!" The last
agent walked into his room and slammed the door behind him. Five large BANGS
came from the room. Then all of a sudden SMASH SMASH SMASH!!. The test
coordinator opened up the door and said "WHAT THE HELL HAPPENED IN HERE!" The
agent looked at him and said, "The gun you gave me was filled with blanks so I
finished her off with the chair."

REDNECK LOGIC

Two rednecks decided that they weren't going anywhere in life and thought they
should go to college to get ahead.
The first went in to see the counselor, who told him to take math, history, and
logic.
"What's logic? the first redneck asked.
The professor answered, "Let me give you an example. Do you own a weed eater?"
"I sure do.
"Then I can assume, using logic, that you have a yard, replied the professor.
"That's real good! said the redneck.
The professor continued, "Logic will also tell me that since you have a yard,
you also own a house."
Impressed, the redneck said, "Amazing!"
"And since you own a house, logic dictates that you have a wife.
"That's Betty Mae! This is incredible!
The redneck was catching on.
"Finally, since you have a wife, logically I can assume that you are
"heterosexual, said the professor.
"You're absolutely right! Why that's the most fascinatin' thing I ever heard! I
"cain't wait to take that logic class!
The redneck, proud of the new world opening up to him, walked back into the
hallway where his friend was still waiting.
"So what classes are ya takin'? asked the friend.
"Math, history, and logic! replied the first redneck.
"What in tarnation is logic? asked his friend.
"Let me give you an example. Do ya own a weed eater? asked the first redneck.
"No, his friend replied.
"You're gay, ain't ya?

Two men considering a religious vocation were having a conversation. "What is
similar about the Jesuit and Dominican Orders? " the one asked.

The second replied, "Well, they were both founded by Spaniards -- St. Dominic

both founded to combat heresy -- the Dominicans to fight the Albigensians, and
the Jesuits to fight the Protestants."

"What is different about the Jesuit and Dominican Orders?

smoked!"

Jesus was walking along one day, when He came upon a group of people surrounding
a lady of ill repute. It was obvious that the crowd was preparing to stone her,
so Jesus made His now-famous statement, "Let the person who has no sin cast the
first stone."

The crowd was shamed and one by one began to turn away. All of a sudden, a
lovely little woman made her way through the crowd. Finally getting to the
front, she tossed a pebble towards the woman.

Jesus looks over and says, "I really hate it when you do that, Mom."

An Irishman moves into a tiny hamlet in County Kerry, walks into the pub and
promptly orders three beers.  The bartender raises his eyebrows, but serves the
man three beers, which he drinks quietly at a table, alone.  An hour later, the
man has finished the three beers and orders three more.

This happens yet again.

The next evening the man again orders and drinks three beers at a time, several
times. Soon the entire town is whispering about the Man Who Orders Three Beers.

Finally, a week later, the bartender broaches the subject on behalf of the town.
"I don't mean to pry, but folks around here are wondering why you always order
three beers?"

'Tis odd, isnt it?" the man replies, "You see, I have two brothers, and one went
'to America, and the other to Australia. We promised each other that we would
'always order an extra two beers whenever we drank as a way of keeping up the
'family bond."

The bartender and the whole town was pleased with this answer, and soon the Man
Who Orders Three Beers became a local celebrity and source of pride to the
hamlet, even to the extent that out-of-towners would come to watch him drink.

Then, one day, the man comes in and orders only two beers. The bartender pours
them with a heavy heart. This continues for the rest of the evening - he orders
only two beers. The word flies around town. Prayers are offered for the soul of
one of the brothers.

The next day, the bartender says to the man, "Folks around here, me first of
all, want to offer condolences to you for the death of your brother. You know-
the two beers and all..."

The man ponders this for a moment, then replies, "You'll be happy to hear that
my two brothers are alive and well... It's just that I, myself, have decided to
give up drinking for Lent."

The Pope goes to New York. He is picked up at the airport by a limousine. He
looks at the beautiful car and says to the driver, "You know, I hardly ever get
to drive. Would you please let me?"

The driver is understandably hesistant and says, "I'm sorry, but I don't think
I'm supposed to do that."

But the Pope persists, "Please?" The driver finally lets up. "Oh, all right, I
can't really say no to the Pope."

So the Pope takes the wheel, and boy, is he a speed demon! He hits the gas and
goes around 100 mph in a 45 zone. A policeman notices and pulls him over.

The cop walks up and asks the Pope to roll down the window. Startled and
surprised, the young officer asks the Pope to wait a minute. He goes back to his
patrol car and radios the chief.

Cop: Chief, I have a problem.

Chief: What sort of problem?

Cop: Well, you see, I pulled over this guy for driving way over the speed limit
but it's someone really important.

Chief: Important like the mayor?

Cop: No, no, much more important than that.

Chief: Important like the governor?

Cop: Wayyyyyy more important than that.

Chief: Like the president?

Cop: More.

Chief: Who's more important than the president?

Cop: I don't know, but he's got the Pope driving for him!

"Father, my dear old dog is dead. Could you be saying a Mass for him?

Father Patrick replied, "I am so very sorry to hear about your dog's death. But,
unfortunately, I can't say Mass for the poor creature..."

Muldoon said, "I understand, Father, I do. I guess I'll go to this new
denomination down the road; no tellin' what they believe... Do you think $500 is
enough to donate for the service?"

Late one night, a burglar broke into a house he thought was empty. He tiptoed
through the living room but suddenly he froze in his tracks when he heard a loud
voice say: "Jesus is watching you!"

Silence returned to the house, so the burglar crept forward again. "Jesus is
watching you," the voice boomed again. The burglar stopped dead again. He was
frightened. Frantically, he looked all around. In a dark corner, he spotted a
bird cage and in the cage was a parrot. He asked the parrot:

"Was that you who said Jesus is watching me? Yes, said the parrot. The burglar
"breathed a sigh of relief and asked the parrot: What's your name? Clarence,
"said the bird.

"That's a dumb name for a parrot, sneered the burglar. What idiot named you
"Clarence? The parrot said, The same idiot who named the Doberman Jesus.

A pair of Irish ditch diggers were repairing some road damage directly across
the street from a house of prostitution.

They witnessed a Protestant minister lurking about, then duck into the house.

"Would ye look at that, Darby! said Pat. What a shameful disgrace, those
"Protestant reverends sinning in a house the likes of that place! They both
"shook their heads and continued working.

A short time later they watched as a Rabbi looked around cautiously and then
darted into the house when he was satisfied no one was looking. "Did ya see
that, Darby?" Pat asked in shock and disbelief, "Is nothing holy to those Jewish
rabbis? I just can't understand what the world is coming to these days. A man of
the cloth indulging himself in sins of the flesh. T'is a shame, I tell ya!"

Not much later a third man, a Catholic priest, was seen lurking about the house,
looking around to see if anyone was watching, then quietly sneaked in. "Oh no,
Darby, look!" said Pat, removing his cap and crossing himself, "One of the poor
girls musta died...."

A priest and a bus driver both died and went to Heaven at the same time. They
get to the pearly gates where Pope St. Peter greets them. He motions to the
priest, and they both hop in a jeep and go out the back door. There are about 50
acres of rolling hills with a little cottage on the knoll.

St. Peter turns to the priest and says "This will be yours for eternity. A
perfect little cottage, right next to lovely pond, a lush little garden, and a
library full of books."

The priest says, "Thank you so much. This I shall enjoy!" St. Peter drops off
the priest, goes back to the pearly gates and motions to the bus driver.

They hop in a stretch limo and go out the front door. There are about 500 acres
of land, with mountains and lakes and rivers. There is a huge 200-room castle on
one of the mountains, and a wishing well that makes wishes come true. St. Peter
says "This will be yours for eternity. You can live in that castle with servants
to wait on you hand and foot, and you can have everything you want."

The bus driver looks and St. Peter and says "Well, now, don't think I'm not
grateful, but why am I getting so much more than the priest?"

St. Peter just laughs and says "You brought more souls to Heaven! When the
priest preached, everyone fell asleep. When you drove your bus, people prayed!"

Years ago in Ireland, there was a priest who was very anti-British. Every Sunday
he would blast them from the pulpit. He became so notorious that the Pope
himself summoned the priest to Rome for an audience.

"Father, said the Pope, I want that there should be peace between the British
"and the Irish. You're not helping matters at all. I want you to kiss my ring
"and swear by the Blessed Virgin that you'll never so much as mention the
"British in public again.

"But Your Holiness, I - I -  the priest stammered.

"No buts, said the Pope. Swear it here and now or there'll be trouble!

"Aye, Holy Father, sighed the father. All right. I swear it.

The very next Sunday just happened to be Easter, and the priest was back at his
pulpit in Ireland, giving his annual Easter sermon.

He got to the part of the Easter story where Jesus said, "And one of you shall
betray Me."

The priest continues: "Saint Andrew jumps up and says, 'Is it I Lord?' and the
Lord says, 'Nay, Andy darlin', it's not you. Sit down now and dunna worry. Eat
your supper.'

Then Saint John the Divine gets up with tears in his eyes and cries, 'Is it I
Lord?' And the Lord says, 'Nay, Johnny me boy, it's not you. Sit down now and
dunna fret yourself. Eat your supper.'

"Then that dirty dog Judas Iscariot slowww-ly rises to his feet. And he looks
"the Lord right in the eye and says, 'Blimey, Mate. Ya think it's me?

had done, so he decided to go to Confession.

He said, "Bless me, Father, for I have sinned. I feel terrible because during
World War II I hid a refugee in my attic."

The priest said, "But that's not a sin! I wouldn't feel bad about that if I were
you!"

"But I made him agree to pay me 50 Marks for every week he stayed.

The priest said, "Well, I admit that certainly wasn't the most noble thing to
do, charging the man to save his life -- but you did save his life, after all,
and that is a good thing. Don't worry about it too much; God forgives."

The man said, "Oh thank you, Father, that eases my mind. I have only one more
question to ask you -- Do I have to tell him the war is over?"

The 98 year old Mother Superior from Ireland was dying. The nuns gathered around
her bed trying to make her last journey comfortable. They gave her some warm
milk to drink but she refused. Then one of the nuns took the glass back to the
kitchen. Remembering a bottle of Irish whiskey received as a gift the previous
Christmas, she opened and poured a generous amount into the warm milk. Back at
Mother Superior's bed, she held the glass to her lips. Mother drank a little,
then a little more and before they knew it, she had drunk the whole glass down
to the last drop. "Mother," the nuns asked with earnest, "please give us some
wisdom before you die."

She raised herself up in bed and with a pious look on her face said, "Don't sell
that cow".

There was a high school cheerleading squad that died in a bus accident. When
they got to heaven they were met by St. Peter at the gate into heaven. He asked
the first girl if she had done anything with any boys, and she said to St. Peter
that she had held a boys hand, so St. Peter told her to wash her hands in the
holy water before entering heaven. St. Peter then asked the second girl the same
question, and she said she had kissed a boy, so Peter told her to wash her lips
in holy water before entering heaven. Then Peter noticed two farther back in
line girls arguing over their position in line. Peter asked the girls what was
going on, and the one girl said to him, "I'm not gargling that after she sits in
it."
