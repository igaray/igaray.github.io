sample playback: reproducing a clip of audio, uses computer memory to store a pre-recorded sound, which may be played back at a fixed or variable pitch, and can be repeated in a continuous loop to extend the duration of a sound without increasing the memory requirements
wavetable synthesis: Wavetable synthesis is fundamentally based on periodic reproduction of an arbitrary, single-cycle waveform; The distinction from other synthesis methods employing single-cycle waveforms is twofold: 1) multiple single-cycle waveforms are used and 2) some means of modulation of the amplitude and mix the single-cycle waveforms is employed

frequency generators
waveform generator:  a fundamental module in a sound synthesis system, usually produces a basic geometrical waveform with a fixed or variable timbre and variable pitch; Common waveform generator configurations usually included two or three simple waveforms and often a single pseudo-random-noise generator (PRNG)
pseudo-random-noise generator (PRNG)
pulse wave: the timbre of which can be varied by modifying the duty cycle
duty cycle: A duty cycle is the percent of time that an entity spends in an active state as a fraction of the total time under consideration
square wave: a symmetrical pulse wave producing only odd overtones
triangle wave: has a fixed timbre containing only odd harmonics, but is softer than a square wave
sawtooth wave: has a bright raspy timbre and contains odd and even harmonics
white noise
brown noise
pink noise
frequency modulation synthesis:  a form of audio synthesis where the timbre of a simple waveform is changed by frequency modulating it with a modulating frequency that is also in the audio range, resulting in a more complex waveform and a different-sounding tone
