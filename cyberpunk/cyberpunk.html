                        <h1><a class="header" href="#cyberculturecyberpunk" id="cyberculturecyberpunk">Cyberculture.CyberPunk</a></h1>
<p>Cyberpunk is a postmodern and science fiction genre noted for its focus
on &quot;high tech and low life.&quot;[1][2] The name is a portmanteau of
cybernetics and punk, and was originally coined by Bruce Bethke as the
title of his short story &quot;Cyberpunk,&quot; published in 1983.[3][4] It
features advanced science, such as information technology and
cybernetics, coupled with a degree of breakdown or radical change in the
social order.[5] Cyberpunk works are well situated within postmodern
literature.[6]</p>
<p>Cyberpunk plots often center on a conflict among hackers, artificial
intelligences, and megacorporations, and tend to be set in a near-future
Earth, rather than the far-future settings or galactic vistas found in
novels such as Isaac Asimov's Foundation or Frank Herbert's Dune.[7] The
settings are usually post-industrial dystopias but tend to be marked by
extraordinary cultural ferment and the use of technology in ways never
anticipated by its creators (&quot;the street finds its own uses for
things&quot;).[8] Much of the genre's atmosphere echoes film noir, and
written works in the genre often use techniques from detective
fiction.[9]</p>
<pre><code>&quot;Classic cyberpunk characters were marginalized, alienated loners
who lived on the edge of society in generally dystopic futures where
daily life was impacted by rapid technological change, an ubiquitous
datasphere of computerized information, and invasive modification of
the human body.&quot; – Lawrence Person[10]
</code></pre>
<h2><a class="header" href="#style-and-ethos" id="style-and-ethos">Style and ethos</a></h2>
<p>Primary exponents of the cyberpunk field include William Gibson, Neal
Stephenson, Bruce Sterling, Pat Cadigan, Rudy Rucker, and John
Shirley.[11]</p>
<p>Many influential films such as Blade Runner and the Matrix trilogy can
be seen as prominent examples of the cyberpunk style and theme.[7]
Computer games, board games, and role-playing games, such as Cyberpunk
2020 and Shadowrun, often feature storylines that are heavily influenced
by cyberpunk writing and movies. Beginning in the early 1990s, some
trends in fashion and music were also labeled as cyberpunk. Cyberpunk is
also featured prominently in anime,[12] Akira and Ghost in the Shell
being among the most notable.[12]</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#setting" id="setting">Setting</a></h2>
<p>Cyberpunk writers tend to use elements from the hard-boiled detective
novel, film noir, and postmodernist prose to describe the often
nihilistic underground side of an electronic society. The genre's vision
of a troubled future is often called the antithesis of the generally
utopian visions of the future popular in the 1940s and 1950s. Gibson
defined cyberpunk's antipathy towards utopian SF in his 1981 short story
&quot;The Gernsback Continuum,&quot; which pokes fun at and, to a certain extent,
condemns utopian science fiction.[16][17][18]</p>
<p>In some cyberpunk writing, much of the action takes place online, in
cyberspace, blurring the border between actual and virtual reality.[19]
A typical trope in such work is a direct connection between the human
brain and computer systems. Cyberpunk depicts the world as a dark,
sinister place with networked computers dominating every aspect of life.
Giant, multinational corporations have for the most part replaced
governments as centers of political, economic, and even military power.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#protagonists" id="protagonists">Protagonists</a></h2>
<p>Protagonists in cyberpunk writing usually include computer hackers, who
are often patterned on the idea of the lone hero fighting injustice,
such as Robin Hood.[20] One of the cyberpunk genre's prototype
characters is Case, from Gibson's Neuromancer.[21] Case is a &quot;console
cowboy,&quot; a brilliant hacker who had betrayed his organized criminal
partners. Robbed of his talent through a crippling injury inflicted by
the vengeful partners, Case unexpectedly receives a once-in-a-lifetime
opportunity to be healed by expert medical care but only if he
participates in another criminal enterprise with a new crew.</p>
<p>Like Case, many cyberpunk protagonists are manipulated, placed in
situations where they have little or no choice, and although they might
see things through, they do not necessarily come out any further ahead
than they previously were. These anti-heroes—&quot;criminals, outcasts,
visionaries, dissenters and misfits&quot;[22] call to mind the private eye of
detective novels. This emphasis on the misfits and the malcontents is
the &quot;punk&quot; component of cyberpunk.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#society-and-government" id="society-and-government">Society and government</a></h2>
<p>Cyberpunk can be intended to disquiet readers and call them to action.
It often expresses a sense of rebellion, suggesting that one could
describe it as a type of culture revolution in science fiction. In the
words of author and critic David Brin:</p>
<pre><code>...a closer look [at cyberpunk authors] reveals that they nearly
always portray future societies in which governments have become
wimpy and pathetic ...Popular science fiction tales by Gibson,
Williams, Cadigan and others do depict Orwellian accumulations of
power in the next century, but nearly always clutched in the
secretive hands of a wealthy or corporate elite.[23]
</code></pre>
<p>Cyberpunk stories have also been seen as fictional forecasts of the
evolution of the Internet. The earliest descriptions of a global
communications network came long before the World Wide Web entered
popular awareness, though not before traditional science-fiction writers
such as Arthur C. Clarke and some social commentators such as James
Burke began predicting that such networks would eventually form.[24]</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#media" id="media">Media</a></h2>
<h3><a class="header" href="#literature" id="literature">Literature</a></h3>
<p>The science-fiction editor Gardner Dozois is generally acknowledged as
the person who popularized the use of the term &quot;cyberpunk&quot; as a kind of
literature, although Minnesota writer Bruce Bethke coined the term in
1980 for his short story &quot;Cyberpunk,&quot; which was published in the
November 1983 issue of Amazing Science Fiction Stories.[25] The term was
quickly appropriated as a label to be applied to the works of William
Gibson, Bruce Sterling, Pat Cadigan and others. Of these, Sterling
became the movement's chief ideologue, thanks to his fanzine Cheap
Truth. John Shirley wrote articles on Sterling and Rucker's
significance.[26]</p>
<p>William Gibson with his novel Neuromancer (1984) is likely the most
famous writer connected with the term cyberpunk. He emphasized style,
a fascination with surfaces, and atmosphere over traditional
science-fiction tropes. Regarded as ground-breaking and sometimes as
&quot;the archetypal cyberpunk work,&quot;[10] Neuromancer was awarded the Hugo,
Nebula, and Philip K. Dick Awards. After Gibson's popular debut novel,
Count Zero (1986) and Mona Lisa Overdrive (1988) followed. According to
the Jargon File, &quot;Gibson's near-total ignorance of computers and the
present-day hacker culture enabled him to speculate about the role of
computers and hackers in the future in ways hackers have since found
both irritatingly naive and tremendously stimulating.&quot;[27]</p>
<p>Early on, cyberpunk was hailed as a radical departure from
science-fiction standards and a new manifestation of vitality.[28]
Shortly thereafter, however, many critics arose to challenge its status
as a revolutionary movement. These critics said that the SF New Wave of
the 1960s was much more innovative as far as narrative techniques and
styles were concerned.[29] Furthermore, while Neuromancer's narrator may
have had an unusual &quot;voice&quot; for science fiction, much older examples can
be found: Gibson's narrative voice, for example, resembles that of an
updated Raymond Chandler, as in his novel The Big Sleep (1939).[28]
Others noted that almost all traits claimed to be uniquely cyberpunk
could in fact be found in older writers' works—often citing J. G.
Ballard, Philip K. Dick, Harlan Ellison, Stanisław Lem, Samuel R.
Delany, and even William S. Burroughs.[28] For example, Philip K. Dick's
works contain recurring themes of social decay, artificial intelligence,
paranoia, and blurred lines between objective and subjective realities,
and the influential cyberpunk movie Blade Runner is based on one of his
books. Humans linked to machines are found in Pohl and Kornbluth's
Wolfbane (1959) and Roger Zelazny's Creatures of Light and Darkness
(1968).</p>
<p>In 1994, scholar Brian Stonehill suggested that Thomas Pynchon's 1973
novel Gravity's Rainbow &quot;not only curses but precurses what we now
glibly dub cyberspace.&quot;[30] Other important predecessors include Alfred
Bester's two most celebrated novels, The Demolished Man and The Stars My
Destination,[31] as well as Vernor Vinge's novella True Names.[32]</p>
<p>Science-fiction writer David Brin describes cyberpunk as &quot;the finest
free promotion campaign ever waged on behalf of science fiction.&quot; It may
not have attracted the &quot;real punks,&quot; but it did ensnare many new
readers, and it provided the sort of movement that postmodern literary
critics found alluring. Cyberpunk made science fiction more attractive
to academics, argues Brin; in addition, it made science fiction more
profitable to Hollywood and to the visual arts generally. Although the
&quot;self-important rhetoric and whines of persecution&quot; on the part of
cyberpunk fans were irritating at worst and humorous at best, Brin
declares that the &quot;rebels did shake things up. We owe them a debt.&quot;[33]</p>
<p>Cyberpunk further inspired many professional writers who were not among
the &quot;original&quot; cyberpunks to incorporate cyberpunk ideas into their own
works, such as George Alec Effinger's When Gravity Fails. Wired
magazine, created by Louis Rossetto and Jane Metcalfe, mixes new
technology, art, literature, and current topics in order to interest
today’s cyberpunk fans, which Paula Yoo claims &quot;proves that hardcore
hackers, multimedia junkies, cyberpunks and cellular freaks are poised
to take over the world.&quot;[34]</p>
<h3><a class="header" href="#film-and-television" id="film-and-television">Film and television</a></h3>
<p>The film Blade Runner (1982), adapted from Philip K. Dick's Do Androids
Dream of Electric Sheep?, is set in 2019 in a dystopian future in which
manufactured beings called replicants are slaves used on space colonies
and are legal prey on Earth to various bounty hunters who &quot;retire&quot;
(kill) them. Although Blade Runner was largely unsuccessful in its first
theatrical release, it found a viewership in the home video market and
became a cult film.[35] Since the movie omits the religious and mythical
elements of Dick's original novel (e.g. empathy boxes and Wilbur
Mercer), it falls more strictly within the cyberpunk genre than the
novel does. William Gibson would later reveal that upon first viewing
the film, he was surprised at how the look of this film matched his
vision when he was working on Neuromancer. The film's tone has since
been the staple of many cyberpunk movies, such as The Matrix (1999),
which uses a wide variety of cyberpunk elements.</p>
<p>The number of films in the genre or at least using a few genre elements
has grown steadily since Blade Runner. Several of Philip K. Dick's works
have been adapted to the silver screen. The films Johnny Mnemonic[36]
and New Rose Hotel,[37][38] both based upon short stories by William
Gibson, flopped commercially and critically.</p>
<p>In addition, &quot;tech-noir&quot; film as a hybrid genre, means a work of
combining neo-noir and science fiction or cyberpunk. It includes many
cyberpunk films such as Blade Runner, The Terminator, 12 Monkeys, The
Lawnmower Man, Hackers, Hardware, and Strange Days.</p>
<h3><a class="header" href="#anime-and-manga" id="anime-and-manga">Anime and manga</a></h3>
<p>Cyberpunk themes are widely visible in anime and manga. In Japan, where
cosplay is popular and not only teenagers display such fashion styles,
cyberpunk has been accepted and its influence is widespread. William
Gibson’s Neuromancer, whose influence dominated the early cyberpunk
movement, was also set in Chiba, one of Japan’s largest industrial
areas, although at the time of writing the novel Gibson did not know the
location of Chiba and had no idea how perfectly it fit his vision in
some ways. The exposure to cyberpunk ideas and fiction in the mid 1980s
has allowed it to seep into the Japanese culture. Even though most anime
and manga is written in Japan, the cyberpunk anime and manga have a more
futuristic and therefore international feel to them so they are widely
accepted by all. “The conceptualization involved in cyberpunk is more of
forging ahead, looking at the new global culture. It is a culture that
does not exist right now, so the Japanese concept of a cyberpunk future,
seems just as valid as a Western one, especially as Western cyberpunk
often incorporates many Japanese elements.”[39] William Gibson is now
a frequent visitor to Japan, and he came to see that many of his visions
of Japan have become a reality:</p>
<pre><code>Modern Japan simply was cyberpunk. The Japanese themselves knew it
and delighted in it. I remember my first glimpse of Shibuya, when
one of the young Tokyo journalists who had taken me there, his face
drenched with the light of a thousand media-suns—all that towering,
animated crawl of commercial information—said, &quot;You see? You see? It
is Blade Runner town.&quot; And it was. It so evidently was.[40]
</code></pre>
<p>Cyberpunk has influenced many anime and manga including the
ground-breaking Armitage III, Blame!, Akira, Battle Angel Alita and
Ghost in the Shell.</p>
<h3><a class="header" href="#games--online" id="games--online">Games &amp; Online</a></h3>
<p>Several role-playing games (RPGs) called Cyberpunk exist: Cyberpunk,
Cyberpunk 2020 and Cyberpunk v3, by R. Talsorian Games, and GURPS
Cyberpunk, published by Steve Jackson Games as a module of the GURPS
family of RPGs. Cyberpunk 2020 was designed with the settings of William
Gibson's writings in mind, and to some extent with his approval[citation
needed], unlike the approach taken by FASA in producing the transgenre
Shadowrun game. Both are set in the near future, in a world where
cybernetics are prominent. In addition, Iron Crown Enterprises released
an RPG named Cyberspace, which was out of print for several years until
recently being re-released in online PDF form.</p>
<p>In 1990, in a convergence of cyberpunk art and reality, the United
States Secret Service raided Steve Jackson Games's headquarters and
confiscated all their computers. This was allegedly because the GURPS
Cyberpunk sourcebook could be used to perpetrate computer crime. That
was, in fact, not the main reason for the raid, but after the event it
was too late to correct the public's impression.[41] Steve Jackson Games
later won a lawsuit against the Secret Service, aided by the new
Electronic Frontier Foundation. This event has achieved a sort of
notoriety, which has extended to the book itself as well. All published
editions of GURPS Cyberpunk have a tagline on the front cover, which
reads &quot;The book that was seized by the U.S. Secret Service!&quot; Inside, the
book provides a summary of the raid and its aftermath.</p>
<p>Cyberpunk has also inspired several tabletop, miniature and board games.
Netrunner is a collectible card game introduced in 1996, based on the
Cyberpunk 2020 role-playing game.</p>
<p>Computer games have frequently used cyberpunk as a source of
inspiration, such as the Deus Ex series and the System Shock series as
well as the MMORPG Neocron. Other games, like Blade Runner and the
Matrix games, are based upon genre movies. Electronic Arts and Tilted
Mill also published a game called SimCity Societies in 2007 which
features the ability for a cyberpunk society along with numerous others.
While it is arguable as to whether or not the game as a whole should be
classified as cyberpunk, the widely popular Final Fantasy VII features
many elements of cyberpunk fiction, particularly in regards to its
portrayals of the world-ruling technological corporation Shinra and the
dystopian city of Midgar, which is the center of Shinra power.</p>
<p>In Second Life, the cities of Hangars Liquides [4] [42], Insilico[43]
and S.I.C.[44] are also influenced by the Cyberpunk theme.</p>
<p>Another game was Hell: A Cyberpunk Thriller on the 3DO System.</p>

<h3><a class="header" href="#society-and-counterculture" id="society-and-counterculture">Society and counterculture</a></h3>
<p>Several subcultures have been inspired by cyberpunk fiction. These
include the Cyberdelic counter culture of the late 80s and early 90s.
Cyberdelic, whose adherents referred to themselves as &quot;cyberpunks,&quot;
attempted to blend the psychedelic art and drug movement with the
technology of cyberculture. Early adherents included Timothy Leary, Mark
Frauenfelder and R. U. Sirius. The movement largely faded following the
dot-com bubble implosion of 2000.</p>
<p>Cybergoth is a fashion and dance subculture which draws its inspiration
from cyberpunk fiction, as well as rave and gothic subcultures.</p>
<p>In addition, a distinct cyberpunk fashion of its own has emerged in
recent years which rejects the raver and goth influences of cybergoth.</p>

<h3><a class="header" href="#literary-subgenres-and-connected-genres" id="literary-subgenres-and-connected-genres">Literary subgenres and connected genres</a></h3>
<p>As a wider variety of writers began to work with cyberpunk concepts, new
sub-genres of science fiction emerged, some which could be considered as
playing off the cyberpunk label, others which could be considered as
legitimate explorations into newer territory. These focused on
technology and its social effects in different ways. One prominent
subgenre is &quot;steampunk,&quot; which is set in an alternate history Victorian
era that combines anachronistic technology with cyberpunk's bleak film
noir world view. The term was originally coined around 1987 as a joke to
describe some of the novels of Tim Powers, James P. Blaylock, and K.W.
Jeter, but by the time Gibson and Sterling entered the subgenre with
their collaborative novel The Difference Engine the term was being used
earnestly as well.[47]</p>
<p>Another subgenre is &quot;biopunk&quot; (cyberpunk themes dominated by
biotechnology) from the early 1990s, a derivative style building on
biotechnology rather than informational technology. In these stories,
people are changed in some way not by mechanical means, but by genetic
manipulation. Paul Di Filippo is seen as the most prominent biopunk
writer, including his half-serious ribofunk. Bruce Sterling's
Shaper/Mechanist cycle is also seen as a major influence. In addition,
some people consider works such as Neal Stephenson's The Diamond Age to
be postcyberpunk.</p>
<h3><a class="header" href="#music" id="music">Music</a></h3>
<p>Some musicians and acts have been classified as cyberpunk due to their
aesthetic style and musical content. Often dealing with dystopian
visions of the future or biomechanical themes, some fit more squarely in
the category than others. Bands whose music has been classified as
cyberpunk include Psydoll, Front Line Assembly, Atari Teenage Riot and
Sigue Sigue Sputnik. Some musicians not normally associated with
cyberpunk have at times been inspired to create concept albums exploring
such themes. Nine Inch Nails' concept album Year Zero fits into this
category. Billy Idol's Cyberpunk drew heavily from cyberpunk literature
and the cyberdelic counter culture in its creation. 1. Outside,
a cyberpunk narrative fueled concept album by David Bowie, was warmly
met by critics upon its release in 1995. Many musicians have also taken
inspiration from specific cyberpunk works or authors, including Sonic
Youth, whose albums Sister and Daydream Nation take influence from the
works of Phillip K. Dick and William Gibson respectively.</p>
<p>Industrial music can be seen as cyberpunk, as well as various electronic
body music acts.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#postcyberpunk" id="postcyberpunk">Postcyberpunk</a></h2>
<p>As new writers and artists began to experiment with cyberpunk ideas, new
varieties of fiction emerged, sometimes addressing the criticisms
leveled at the original cyberpunk stories. Lawrence Person wrote in an
essay he posted to the Internet forum Slashdot:</p>
<pre><code>Many writers who grew up reading in the 1980s are just now starting
to have their stories and novels published. To them cyberpunk was
not a revolution or alien philosophy invading science fiction, but
rather just another flavor of science fiction. Like the writers of
the 1970s and 80s who assimilated the New Wave's classics and
stylistic techniques without necessarily knowing or even caring
about the manifestos and ideologies that birthed them, today's new
writers might very well have read Neuromancer back to back with
Asimov's Foundation, John Brunner's Stand on Zanzibar, and Larry
Niven's Ringworld and seen not discontinuities but a continuum.[2]
</code></pre>
<p>Person's essay advocates using the term postcyberpunk to label the new
works such writers produce. In this view, typical postcyberpunk stories
continue the focus on a ubiquitous datasphere of computerized
information and cybernetic augmentation of the human body, but without
the assumption of dystopia (see Technological utopianism). Good examples
are Neal Stephenson's The Diamond Age and Bruce Sterling's Holy Fire. In
television, Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex has been called &quot;the
most interesting, sustained postcyberpunk media work in existence.&quot;[4]
In 2007, SF writers James Patrick Kelly and John Kessel published
Rewired: The Post-Cyberpunk Anthology. Like all categories discerned
within science fiction, the boundaries of postcyberpunk are likely to be
fluid or ill defined.[5]</p>
