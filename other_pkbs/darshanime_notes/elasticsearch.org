Elasticsearch is built on top of Apache Lucene. It is a "full text search engine" library. 
Elasticsearch is a wrapper around Lucene, it hides the internal details of Lucene behind a coherent, REST API. It can be described as:

- a distributed real-time document store where every field is indexed and search-able.
  - "Distributed" - the data is sharded and partitioned.
  - Real time - the new documents are index online and are immediately available for query
  - Document Store - Elasticsearch accepts json documents


Elasticsearch has sensible defaults and is usable out of the box. It is also highly configurable, all the components are configurable and flexible.

Marvel is a management and monitoring tool used for Elasticsearch. It has an interactive console called Sense. Recall we used this in the early days with Piyush

Elasticsearch comes as a binary which runs in the JVM. You just need Java installed on your machine to run Elasticsearch

A node is a running instance of Elasticsearch. A cluster is a group of nodes with the same cluster.name that are working together to share data and to provide failover and scale,

If you don't change the ~cluster.name~, your nodes could join other nodes in a different cluster on the same network.

API to shutdown Elasticsearch : ~curl -XPOST 'http://localhost:9200/_shutdown'~
* Part 1
** You Know, for Search

Elasticsearch can be reached by 2 means:
1. Java API
When using Java, you can use these
  - Node Client
It joins a cluster as a non data node, it doesn't hold the data itself, it knows where the data lives.
  - Transport Client
It is lighter weight client and can be used to transport client to a remote cluster. 

Both the clients use a custom elasticsearch transport protocol to talk to the cluster. 

2. RESTful API with JSON over HTTP

All other languages can communicate with Elasticsearch over port 9200 using a RESTful API

------

Elasticsearch uses JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) as the serialization format for documents.

JSON allows for rich information storage which can be difficult if we move to a tabular structure.
