- In a single sentence, "ECS is a service to automate the running of containers on a fleet of instances"
- It orchestrates the deployment(placement, self heal) and running of the containers
- ECS has an agent like the kubelet, running on each instance.

- after creating a cluster, we need to define a task.
- A Task is a json document which defines what to run on the cluster
  - it references an image to download, volumes etc
  - Tasks are versioned
- use the console to launch a submitted task

- launching a task is good for a one off script etc
- we could also launch a Service
