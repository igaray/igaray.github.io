<p>DEFINITION</p>
<p>Entity Systems (ES) are a technique/architecture for building complex extensible
projects (mostly: computer games) based around pluggable behaviours and lean,
fast, modular data.
This makes the programming process leaner and easier to extend, with advantages
in: performance, extensibility, and game-design flexibility</p>
<p>What is an Entity System?</p>
<pre><code>An entity system (also known as a Entity Component System) consists of three primary items:

    Components
        A component simply holds a piece of data and does not contain any game logic. 
        Your typical component will have fields for primitive values and data objects.

    Entities
        An entity is a collection of components.

    Systems
        A system is typically an implementation that iteratively operates on a group of entities that share a specific set of components.
</code></pre>
<p>Entity/Component Game Design: A Primer</p>
<p>Object-oriented games
In a traditional OO design, every “thing” in the game is defined by its own
class. Naturally there is a great deal of similarity between some classes,
and so they can inherit common behaviour from more abstract classes.</p>
<pre><code>The design of an object-oriented game will require a detailed design of this
class hierarchy, with each concrete in-game object inheriting from a tree of
increasingly abstract classes, right up to something like GameObject, which
may just represent anything with an ID assigned to it. If this hierarchy is
planned out well before implementation, then it’s quite possible to build a
large, complex game leveraging OO inheritance.

However, the deeper your class hierarchy grows, the more brittle and fragile
it becomes. If (read: when) the requirements change after implementation
begins, reflecting those changes in the code will often require adding
and/or removing functionality to some of those abstract classes. Such
changes will flow on to affect all subclasses, whether or not those
subclasses need the changes. The result is messy code additions that get
pushed up towards the root of the (upside-down) tree in order to provide the
changes to a greater number of subclasses.
</code></pre>
<p>Entity/component games
One of the core principles of good software design is modularity: breaking
down the core components of a system into individual, independent units, and
then building the system as a whole by plugging these components together.
There are many benefits of modularity, including, most relevantly,
flexibility. If one component needs to change, a modified component can be
plugged in to replace the old component without affecting the rest of the
system. So long as the rest of the system can talk to the new component in
the same way as they did the old one (i.e. it conforms to the same
interface), then they are oblivious that a change even occurred.</p>
<p>Traditional Components
An Entity represents a concrete “thing” in the world, such as a Tank.
However an Entity has no Tank-specific logic; an Entity barely has any logic
at all, and is little more than an ID.</p>
<pre><code>A Component is a module of functionality, an attribute. Components are
things that Entities have, like Position, Velocity, RenderableMesh, and
PhysicalBody. An Entity is little more than a bag of Components; it is the
sum of its parts. The Entity has no explicit knowledge of what parts it
contains, meaning all entities can be treated the same way by the rest of
the game.

This is possible because the components take care of themselves, regardless
of which entity they belong to. The RenderableMesh component contains the
capability to render a 3D model.

The model is assigned to the component, and the component is assigned to the
entity, so the entity doesn’t need to know what the model looks like. All
the entity needs to do is call some generic update function on each of its
components each frame, and each component will do its own thing.

The advantage of such a system is that the components are generic, they
perform a single role, and they perform it the same way regardless of their
parent entity.

As a result, different types of entities can be manufactured easily by
plugging different reusable components into an empty entity.

This is good for maintaining flexibility during and after development!
Changes to entities will typically involve changing one or two components in
isolation, without changing any unrelated components or polluting other
entities. New functionality can be added with the independent addition of
new components.
</code></pre>
<p>Weaknesses
The unfortunate weakness of this system is that there are inherent
relationships between the components which requires them to be coupled in
some way or other. They are, after all, parts of a single whole.</p>
<pre><code>The Velocity component can very well keep track of velocity, but it’s not
much good without being able to update the Position component.

One proposed solution is to push this ‘shared data’ up into the Entity
itself, so that all components can read and write to the position variable.
However this leads to an analogous problem to that of the traditional OO
hierarchy; it’s a slippery slope.

Another solution is to allow components to hold references to each other and
communicate directly, but this has multiple drawbacks associated with it.
For one, it couples the components very tightly, making them difficult to
reuse under different circumstances. In addition, all these references need
to be assigned when the entity is created, but without the entity’s direct
intervention, which is a non-trivial problem in itself. One possible sub-
solution is to implement some elaborate system of runtime inter-component
dependency resolution and injection, which adds a mountain of complexity to
what should be a molehill of an obstacle (simply plugging in components).

An alternative to holding direct references between components is to attach
a message dispatching system to each entity, allowing components to fire
events when something interesting happens, and handle other events of
interest fired by other components. This has the advantage of decoupling the
components which is nice, but comes at the cost of, once again, increased
complexity and a persistent performance penalty.

Even if you manage to get all your components hooked up and working
together, completely encapsulating the logic related to each component
within the component itself is fraught with the danger of your components
becoming bloated with functionality. In theory, a Physics component should
handle all physical interaction between its parent entity and the rest of
the world, but does the knowledge of the rest of the world really belong in
a component? Perhaps we can split out the physics calculations into a
centralised physics manager… So then which components have logic and which
don’t, and how much?
</code></pre>
<p>Comments</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>I think it unwise/incorrect to have components render themselves. That would
be the function of the Rendering <em>System</em>. Components have data and “local”
logic/methods which change themselves but not the game world. It should be
the Systems which facilitate inter-component communications though a quick
fix is to give each component a reference to their entity and allow them to
getComponent(). Thus the Collision Component gets its own enitity’s position
with getComponent(‘Position’) and the test object (e.g. a bullet entity)
from the Collision System.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The “Object-oriented games” section is a complete straw-man. It describes a
type of design that commonly occurred when people learn OOP, but not OOD.
That design, while written in an object-oriented language, is not an object-
oriented design because it’s completely abusing inheritance in ways that the
rules behind OOD forbid. The idea of breaking down the class hierarchy into
smaller modules comes from people actually learning OOD, or just googling
“inheritance vs composition” and realizing how they’ve been abusing OO all
along</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Entity Systems are the future of MMOG development 2</p>
<p>What is an Entity System?</p>
<pre><code>An entity system is simply a part of your program that uses a particular way
of breaking up the logic and variables of your program into source code.

We refer to an entity “system” instead of entity “programming” because ES’s
are usually found embedded in a larger, OOP, program. They are used to solve
a subset of problems that OOP is poor at dealing with.

So, it is generally a replacement for Object Oriented Programming. The two
are mutually exclusive: you have to choose one or the other (although any
complex program may have multiple levels of abstraction, and you could mix
and match OOP and COP/ES at different layers, any given layer is going to be
one or the other or any other alternative way of structuring your program).

Common misconception #1 – Entity Systems are part of OOP
Common misconception #2 – Entity == Class, Component == Object

Where OOP has Classes and Objects, an ES has Entities and Components. Note
that an Entity is NOT equivalent to a class, and a Component is NOT
equivalent to an Object, although superficially they seem to share some
characteristics.
</code></pre>
<p>What’s an Entity?</p>
<pre><code>An Entity System is so named because Entities are the fundamental conceptual
building block of your system, with each entity representing a different
concrete in-game object. For every discernible “thing” in your game-world,
you have one Entity. Entities have no data and no methods.

In terms of number of instances at runtime, they are like Objects from OOP
(if you have 100 identical tanks, you have 100 Entities, not 1).

In terms of behaviour, they are like classes (Entities indirectly define all
the behaviour of the in-game object – we’ll see how in a second).

So, entities on their own are pretty much entirely useless – they are
coarse-grained, and they serve to do little more than to tag every coarse
gameobject as a separate item. This is where Components come in.
</code></pre>
<p>What’s a Component?</p>
<pre><code>Every in-game item has multiple facets, or aspects, that explain what it is
and how it interacts with the world.

A bicycle, for instance, is:
  Made of metal
  Can be used by a human
  A means of transportation
  Something that can be bought and sold
  A popular birthday present
  Man-made

OOP does not have this concept of multiple aspects; it hard-codes all the
aspects into one glob, and declares that the set of behaviours and values of
data to be the single-aspected Class of an Object. C++’s Multiple
inheritance and Java’s Interfaces can get you a small part of the way
towards the aspects of an ES, but they quickly collapse under the strain in
fundamental ways that cannot be fixed within OOP.

The way that an Entity for an item represents the different aspects of the
item is to have one Component for each aspect. The Component does one really
important thing:

Labels the Entity as possessing this particular aspect

It may do several other things, depending upon your implementation and the
design of your ES. However, with an ES, this is the most important, because
this is the basis of all method execution and processing.
</code></pre>
<p>What’s a System? (or subsystem)</p>
<pre><code>An ES goes further than OOP in how it splits up the universe of code and
data. In OOP, you make everything into Objects. With an ES, you have two
different things that you split code and data into: the first is “Entity +
Components”, and the second is “Systems”.

This is the source of a lot of the value of an ES. OOP is very good at
implementing the part of any program that has lots of data floating around
and lots of methods floating around which need to be executed only on a
small, instanced, subset of the data in the program. OOP is very poor at
implementing the “global” parts of a program, which have to operate “on
everything”, or have to be invoked “from everywhere”. An ES solves this by
explicitly dealing with all the global stuff using Systems, which are
outside the realm of Entity/Component.

Each System runs continuously (as though each System had it’s own private
thread) and performs global actions on every Entity that possesses a
Component of the same aspect as that System.

There is a one to one relationship between Systems and AVAILABLE aspects
(i.e. types of Component). A System essentially provides the method-
implementation for Components of a given aspect, but it does it back-to-
front compared to OOP. OOP style would be for each Component to have zero or
more methods, that some external thing has to invoke at some point. ES style
is for each Component to have no methods but instead for the continuously
running system to run it’s own internal methods against different Components
one at a time.

Typical Systems in a game would be: Rendering System, Animation System,
Input System, etc.

The Rendering system wakes up every 16 milliseconds, renders every Entity
that has the Renderable Component, and then goes back to sleep.

The Animation system constantly looks out for anything that would trigger a
new animation, or cause an existing animation to change (e.g. player changes
direction mid-step), and updates the data of each affected Entity (of
course, only those that actually have the Animatable Component, i.e. are
animations).

The Input system polls the gamepad, mouse, etc, and changes the state of
whichever Entities with the Inputable Component are currently marked as
being controlled by the player.

In tradtional OOP, if you have 100 units on a battlefield, and each is
represented by an object, then you theoretically have 100 copies of each
method that can be invoked on a unit. In practice, most OOP languages use
runtime and compiler optimizations to share those methods behind the scenes
and avoid wasting memory – although scripting languages for instance often
don’t do any sharing, allowing all the methods to be independently changed
on each and every instance.

By contrast, in an ES, if you have 100 units on a battlefield, each
represented by an Entity, then you have zero copies of each method that can
be invoked on a unit – because Entities do not contain methods. Nor do
Components contain methods. Instead, you have an external system for each
aspect, and that external system contains all the methods that can be
invoked on any Entity that possess the Component that marks it as being
compatible with this system.
</code></pre>
<p>That’s not an Entity System!</p>
<pre><code>Well … at least, that’s what *most* people I’ve worked with consider to be
an Entity System. But even within a single project, I’ve found multiple
different ideas of what an ES is, some of which are compatible, others of
which are incompatible. Here are some of the other ideas I’ve come across
that people thought were ES’s.

Alternative definitions of entity systems:

1.
  An ES provides a different model of class-inheritance to OOP, especially
  w.r.t inheritance of fields. For any given entity-class you declare which
  aspects that class possesses, and the actual class is looked-up at runtime
  by piecing together all the different aspects.

2.
  The same as 1., but taken literally for methods as well as fields, i.e.
  this provides an interesting way to mix-n-match inheritance of
  functions/methods. So long as methods are attached to the fields upon
  which they operate, and/or a “pre-requisite” system is implemented such
  that “having aspect X automatically causes you to also have aspect Y”,
  then this works quite smoothly. NB: this is implementing “modular
  objects”: the “aspects” are complete objects from the standard theory of
  OOP.

3.
  A variant on 1. or 2. where the aspect data is pre-compiled into a large
  number of OOP classes at compile time, so that at runtime you are just
  running “normal” classes, without any lookup cost of the dynamic “I’ve got
  an entity E which claims to have aspect X; just hold on a sec while I
  build a function table to find out what the heck to do now someone just
  tried to invoke function Z…”

4.
  A way of compiling standard OOP classes into runtime-data (note:
  disassociating them from their OOP-ness) specifically so that you can
  treat them as streamed data instead of chunked binary + data. The main
  value of this is to play nicely with hardware that has tiny tiny amounts
  of memory available in the code cache and/or very very slow access to
  fetch extra code, but has vast bandwidth to stream SEQUENTIAL data through
  the CPU. PlayStation consoles especially like this approach, as opposed to
  the typical PC approaches. Note that in this case, the idea is that the
  game-programmers and game-designers are UNAWARE that there’s an entity
  system – it’s a runtime/compile time performance optimization, not a
  design-feature.

5.
  A system design that revolves around excessive use of the Observer
  pattern, but does so using standard OOP techniques. I mention this because
  it’s a common (ab)use of the concepts of ES’s, but lacks much of the
  advantages. For what it’s worth … that’s the situation I was in when I
  first discovered ES’s. So, personally, I really don’t count these as ES’s.
  These are not an ES, but an: “OMG, I need an ES!”, but many people persist
  in thinking (and claiming) they’re a true ES.

  IMHO this is one of those “you really shouldn’t do this” classes of Entity
  System usage. Why? Because you end up just creating MASSIVE OOP classes
  with tonnes of independent implemented Observer methods tacked onto them.
  That’s fine as a general approach, it buys you something whilst remaining
  ENTIRELY OOP, but it also loses most of what ES’s have to offer,
  especially in the realm of flexibility and compound inheritance.
</code></pre>
<p>Who cares about ES’s and why? (where did they invent these from?)</p>
<pre><code>1. Coders who are used to writing a graphics/rendering engine and trying to
keep it isolated / separate from the rest of the computer game. They learnt
that they can write the entire graphics engine using only PARTIAL
information (a couple of aspects – no more than 2 or 3) of every OOP object
that exists in the game-universe. They need to use: Renderable (do I have to
paint it to the screen every frame? [it will have all the methods necessary
to do that painting generically]), Updateable (does it potentially change in
response to one or more game-loop-ticks? [animations are a great example of
this - their internal state changes independently of how many times they're
rendered]),

2. Multi-threaded coders who are looking at the concept of aspects per se
(i.e. Renderable as opposed to Updateable) to allow for coarse-grained
multi-threading: you are allowed one thread per aspect, and this is
guaranteed safe simply because the aspects are – by definition! –
independent from one another. Since a typical ES will have a dozen or more
aspects, you’ve just bought yourself reasonably effective performance
scaling of up to 12 separate CPU cores, for free.

Also … going to the next level of difficulty and performance improvement,
they’re looking for the largest possible individual (literally: things that
“cannot be divided”) things that can be made the atomic level of multi-
threading. The default position is that only manually-hard-coded atomic
operations count, and OOP objects certainly are full of all sorts of multi-
threading individual pieces so are far too coarse, but maybe components
within entities are small enough to be the unit of atomicity.

3. Game designers who want to enable “everything to become anything”.
- Do Cameras shoot people?
- Do Bullets accept input from the player?
ES’s allow everything and anything to be used as anything and everything,
interchangeably, with no re-coding. That’s the beauty for designers – all
the artifical constraints on design that were previously enforced by coders
having to, you know, place SOME constraints just to write their own damn
code and have it be reasonably performant and bug-free are suddenly lifted.
You can have strongly-typed safe code and yet have total freedom to pass any
object to any method; at least, you can with Entity Systems.

4. Coders who go a bit overboard with the Observer pattern.
If you’re unsure about this one, and have used Observers a lot, ask yourself
this: have you ever had that problem with Observers where you found that
“just one base class isn’t enough”? i.e. one base class that implemented a
handful of different Observers worked great, but as your system / game /
application expanded you found you needed more variety in that base class,
you needed multiple different versions, and you needed *every possible
combination* of those different versions, because base-classes cannot/will
not “stack” nicely on top of each other.

<p>Thought for the day</p>
<pre><code>Programming *well* with Entity Systems is very close to programming with a
Relational Database. It would not be unreasonable to call ES’s a form of
“Relation Oriented Programming”.
Bear in mind that no-one’s yet managed to do OOP fast with Relations; the
excessively high conversion cost between RDBMS and OOP – both at coding-time
and at runtime – is still one of the biggest single development problems
with writing an MMO.

<p>Questions that have been raised in response to the first two posts:
* what data and methods are stored in the OOP implementation of an entity?
* where does the data “live”?

<p>What, exactly, is an entity?</p>
<pre><code>For every discernible thing in your game-world, you have one Entity.
Entities have no data and no methods

But what ACTUALLY is it, when you start implementing the thing? Is it a
class? Is it an array of data? Is it a list of Components?

The last statement is particularly important: actually, entities have NO
data and NO methods – an entity is not a stub for a class, it is not a
struct of data, and – ideally – it’s not a list of Components. An entity is
really just a name. Last post I also wrote that entities “do little more
than to tag every gameobject as a separate item” – and that’s the key thing
here, an entity is just a unique label for an in-game object.

I was a bit non-specific, because I didn’t want to say empirically that an
entity cannot or should not be a list of components – sure, you CAN
implement it that way – because many people do implement entities like that,
and who’s to say what’s right or wrong here?

I actually think that *is* the wrong way, and think that by the time you get
to the last of these Entity Systems posts, you’ll probably agree with me ;).
The problem is, the right way is usually too slow, so you’ll probably end up
*to some extent* implementing entities as lists anyway, but if you do so as
a performance optimization (e.g. by hiding that detail from the rest of the
system) rather than as a logical implementation, it’ll cause fewer problems
with your code in the long term.

So, to answer the question directly: What is an entity?
  An Entity is a number (a globally unique number)

Gotcha number 1: only OOP programmers want to give entities hierarchical
names. It can turn out a pretty dumb idea, if you think about it: it’s
usually an implicit refusal to let go of those OOP ways we’re so used to
thinking in, when those OOP ways are exactly what caused most of the
problems we’re trying to fix by using ES’s.

So, don’t be tempted into hierarchical encoding, and definitely don’t do ANY
encoding in the entity names – there’s a much BETTER place to do metadata
for entities (trust me).

And I’ll be calling the implementation of an entity a GUID from now on
(“Globally Unique IDentifier”).
</code></pre>
<p>What data and methods are stored in the OOP implementation of an entity?</p>
<pre><code>The answer for the previous question makes this one easy to answer: none.
The entity is merely a label, and whilst you DO want to store and manipulate
some metadata around that label (e.g. it’s kind of handy to have a list of
all the entity names you’ve currently got in memory, and be able to rename
them without breaking everything), you should be thinking of them as nothing
more or less than a GUID (String. Number. Whatever!).
</code></pre>
<p>Where does the data “live”?</p>
<pre><code>The first time I made an ES, I implemented the individual Entities as classes,
and although I didn’t put any methods in those classes , I did put the data
into them. It didn’t occur to me that I’d need to worry about where the data
was living, so I just stuck it somewhere natural – in the Entity.

Of course, I’d made a cardinal error, because whatever feels “natural” to an
OOP programmer is usually “completely wrong” in ES programming.

Anyway, the last time I did an ES I was a lot wiser, and so we put the data
inside the Components. All of it.

Gotcha 2: ALL the data goes into the Components. ALL of it. Think you can take
some “really common” data, e.g. the x/y/z co-ords of the in-game object, and
put it into the Entity itself? Nope. Don’t go there. As soon as you start
migrating data into the Entity, you’ve lost. BY DEFINITION the only valid
place for the data is inside the Component.

How does that work?

Well, you need to start thinking about your Components a bit more carefully
here. I previously said that:

  A Component labels the Entity as possessing this particular aspect

So, again, a Component is merely another “label”, just like the Entity
itself. Right? Wrong. This is my fault – in the last post, I was trying to
Keep It Simple for you, and glossed over quite a few things; because the
very first ES I made, I treated the components as mere labels, that
description came out most easily as “the simple version” of what they are.

In more detail:

  A Component is the chunk of stuff that provides a particular aspect to
  any Entity

where “provides” means “does all the things that are necesssary to make this
work”. Which means that all your Components certainly *could* be implemented
as standard OOP objects. To define an Entity, you just provide a name (GUID)
and a list of Component classes that it needs, and to instantiate that
Entity, you just instantiate one object from each class (and then you need
to somehow attach those in-memory objects to your GUID, probably by
implementing the Entity as an empty class that just contains a GUID and a
list-of-component- instances (which I said to avoid, but we’ll come back to
that later)).

But, as you may have noticed by now, I’m vigourously against using OOP
anywhere inside an ES implementation. This isn’t some strange dislike of OOP
itself, it’s just that in my experience with ES development it’s all too
easy for experienced OOP programmers to keep trying to sneak some OOP back
in where it’s inappropriate, and it’s all too easy to delude yourself into
thinking this is a Good Idea. And, worse, from the teams I’ve worked on in
the past, it has consistently seemed that the better you are at OOP
programming, the harder this is to resist…

You COULD implement your Components as OOP objects. But, really, if you go
back to the definition of a “System” from the last post, you’ll see that the
methods for acting upon Components should all live inside the Systems, not
the Components. In fact, re-reading that last post, I notice that I
explicitly described Systems as doing exactly this: “a System essentially
provides the method-implementation for Components”.

One tiny exception to this rule: getters and setters are really useful. If
you’re implementing your ES within an OOP language, you might allow yourself
to implement Components as objects just to get the benefits of get/set and
e.g. multiple different versions of each get/set that do basic type
conversion, or integrity checking on data, etc. Be warned, though, that if
you do you MUST implement them as flyweight objects (go google the Flyweight
Pattern if you don’t know it) or else you’ll lose lots of the memory-
management and efficiency advantages of a full ES.

Where does the data “live”?

Each Component is merely a classification label (e.g. “Renderable”) and a
struct/array/list/whatever of the data relating to it’s purpose; all data
lives in Components; ALL data.
</code></pre>
<p>How do you do gameobject initialization?</p>
<pre><code>I haven’t mentioned ANYTHING about object/entity intialization. It was
really only from trying to use entity systems that I finally realized just
how bizarre OOP is when it comes to initialization: you have some “magic
methods” (constructor, destructor, finalizer, etc) that have nothing to do
with the main description of OOP, but instead are part of a meta-programming
that allows you to get your OOP system up and running, and to keep it
running, and then to tear it all down again at the end. Until then, I’d not
noticed how out-of-place those methods are…

Hats-off to the OOP folks: they integrated their meta-programming so neatly
into OOP that in most languages it’s unnoticeable. But I’ve not yet seen the
same trick done for an ES – so, get used to the fact that initialization is
going to be a bit … “different” …

There’s really a bunch of issues here:
- what’s the technical term for an entity’s archetype?
- how do you define the archetypes for your entities?
- how do you instantiate multiple new entities from a single archetype?
- how do you STORE in-memory entities so that they can be re-instantiated
  later on?
</code></pre>
<p>What’s the technical term for an entity’s archetype?</p>
<pre><code>There doesn’t seem to be one. Really. There’s a couple floating around,
influenced by people’s own backgrounds but I’ve heard quite a few used
interchangeably.

My favourites are:
- template
- model
- assemblage

The problem with both “template” and “model” is that they’re both very
frequently used generic terms in programming. Entity is pretty good as a
term, because it’s hardly used for anything else (and the main obvious
competitor is now widely called a “gameobject” by game programmers). I’ve
used both, in the past. Interchangeably.
</code></pre>
<p>How do you define the archetypes for your entities?
How do you instantiate multiple new entities from a single archetype?
How do you STORE in-memory entities so that they can be re-instantiated later on?</p>
<p>What does the ES bring that cannot be accomplished with an AOP framework?</p>
<pre><code>AOP (Aspect-Oriented Programming) doesn’t really help much to solve the
problems that an Entity System solves (although it does solve similar ones
that ALSO tend to be present when the ES-related ones are present), and
doesn’t provide the new features that you get from an ES (e.g. the improved
memory/data-performance).

An ES takes a system where there are many things going on that are all
independent, which OOP tangles up together, and pulls them apart and lets
them live on their own. It also highly efficiently manages simple
interoperation between those disparate aspects of the program, and allows
them to be disconnected, reconnected, at will.

AOP takes a system where there are things going on that are fundamentally
DEPENDENT, which OOP tangles up together, and allows them to be reasoned
about “separately, but together” – you can view the code for logging
independent of the code which is being logged, but you have to still reason
about them at the same time, you cannot merely ignore one or the other. By
definition, different aspects (vested as Components) of an Entity are
INdependent, and this whole “together” thing is an irrelevance.

AOP certainly helps if you have implemented with OOP something you ideally
should have done with an ES, and you want to add new features to it, because
the tangled OOP system is going to be a pain to modify without breaking
stuff accidentally, and AOP will help you more precisely focus the impact of
your changes. But it’s a poor replacement for just implementing the ES you
wanted in the first place.

There is also a fairly large area of crossover between “some things you can
do with entity systems” and “some things you can do with aspect oriented
programming”, mainly because they are both fundamentally data-driven at the
function-despatch level (which I’ll come back to later). However, they each
use this data-drivenness in very different ways – AOP uses it to react to,
and wrap itself around, the code of the program, whereas an ES uses it to
react to the data of the program.

Using both together could be really exciting – but I’ve not been brave
enough to try that yet myself.
</code></pre>
<p>What’s the link between entity systems and SQL/Relational Databases?</p>
<pre><code>Mathematically-speaking, an Entity is a database Key, just as you’d see in
any RDBMS.

Likewise, from a purely abstracted point of view, the “set of component-
instances that comprise Entity #7742″ is, literally, a database Query.

THIS is why I said at the start that, ideally, you do NOT want to store your
component-instances as a list inside a struct/class representation of each
Entity. Fundamentally, that set is NOT defined as a list (a list is a static
thing, it’s members don’t change without you changing them), it’s defined as
a query (whose members are always changing, whether you want them to or
not), and using one where really you wanted the other tends to cause
problems in the long term.

Obviously, you can use Lists as a simple form of query (that query being
“what things are currently in this list”), but that’s a rather poor and
inflexible kind of query. Life is much more interesting if you embrace the
dynamicity of the query, and fetch the components (and, hence, the VALUES of
the data…) by running a query every time you want one or more of them.

This is a fairly star-gazing view of how to make games: the game is just one
giant database, running dynamic queries all the time. Current performance,
even of fast RDBMS’s, is just way too slow to be running thousands of
queries per frame on a home PC.

However, these articles are about ES’s for massively multiplayer online game
development, not just standard game development, and that changes two things
in particular:

  1. Most of the game is NOT running on home PC’s, it’s running on
  arbitrarily beefy server-farms that are already running bajillions of QL
  queries (nearly always SQL these days, but any of MS SQL Server, Oracle,
  or MySQL).

  2. The data is much much more important than rendering speed; we have
  almost no problem making incredibly beautiful 3D rendered landscapes, but
  managing the data to make those landscapes act and react as if they were
  real (i.e. world-logic, game-logic, etc) is something we still find rather
  hard
</code></pre>
<p>A new thought for the day…</p>
<pre><code>Think what you can do with an ES if you deploy it on an MMO server farm, and
go the full monty by making all your entity/component aggregations stored
merely as SQL queries. Here’s some to start you off…

1.
  No more pain from “Relational vs OOP”

  One of the slowest parts of MMO server performance is translating OOP
  objects into RDBMS tables so that the database can save them, and then
  translating them back again when the game needs to read them. This also
  wastes large amounts of programmer time on boring, annoying, tricky to
  maintain code to handle the serialization processes.

2.
  Massive increase in parallelization for free

  If you make all processing data-driven, and you have no data-structures
  that have to remain synchronized, then it becomes a lot easier to “just
  add more CPU’s” to increase runtime performance…

3.
  Where else could you use SELECT instead of data structures?

  When each System has to do it’s processing, it’s probably going to iterate
  over “all Entities that have my Component”. Is that something you can
  store easily in a standard data-structure? Or is it better off as a QL
  query? And what else can you achieve if you start doing your processing
  this way? (hint: there’s some nice benefits for the low-level network
  programming here…)

<p>Entity Systems are the future of MMOG development 4</p>
<p>Massively Multiplayer Entity Systems: Introduction</p>
<p>What’s the connection between ES and MMO?</p>
<pre><code>The short answer is: it’s all about data. And data is a lot harder than most
people think, whenever you have to deal with an entire system (like an MMO)
instead of just one consumer of a system (like the game-client, which is the
only part of an MMO that traditional games have).
</code></pre>
<p>Massively Multiplayer Game Development 101</p>
<pre><code>There’s a few key things you need to be aware of in MMO development.

1. The vast majority of the cost of MMO development is content

  Content is:
  – quests (missions, storylines, scripted events)
  – 3D areas (meshes, textures and logic for: zones, dungeons, towns,
    landscapes)
  – loot (item graphics, drop rates, item stats, item abilities)

  Content is NOT:
  – Fancy 3D graphics
  – Physics engines
  – AI
  – Core game rules

  …which tend to make up the bulk of non-MMO games.

  As Raph Koster (amongst others, but IIRC Raph was one of the first to come
  up with a clear concise description) pointed out close to 10 years ago,
  the rate at which players consume content vastly excedes the rate at which
  developers generate it – you have perhaps 50 people working purely on
  content generation on a modern MMO, and you have perhaps 500,000 people
  consuming it. The problem is, those 500,000 use Thottbot, so they *share*
  their discoveries, and consume at a rate proportional to the square of
  their number, whereas it’s generally produced at a rate more directly
  proportional to the number of developers.

  There are many ways to work around this issue, but most of them end up
  producing or managing vast amounts of content (they just get more cunning
  in exactly how that content is generated).

2. The vast majority of the development of an MMO takes place AFTER launch

  The ten-year-old MMO’s have been releasing expansions and content updates
  every 6 to 18 months; modern MMO’s release new content every 3 to 12
  months. “New content” in this context generally means entirely new 3D
  areas with entirely new quests and entirely new items, not to mention
  entirely new special abilities and new plotlines. i.e. complete “miniature
  MMOs”.

  The only bits you don’t need to keep rewriting are the technology,
  although nearly all MMOs have done minor updates throughout their
  lifetime, usually when a new expansion pack is released as a retail boxed
  product (if you buy and install the expansion, not only do you get the
  bonus content, but all the “old” content becomes higher resolution / more
  pretty / added sparkly bits). Although … I long wished there was more
  updating of tech, and three major MMOs are currently doing huge updates:
  Ultima Online (1997) recently massively renovated their 10-year old
  graphics as Kingdom Reborn, Eve Online (2001) just completed their
  “shininess and detailed spaceships with added humanoids” update known as
  Trinity, and Anarchy Online (2001) recently previewed massive sweeping
  changes to their very poor detail and draw distance client (they say “the
  current engine was designed before there really were GPUs to utilize” but
  that is blatantly false as the GeForce had been on sale for almost 2 years
  when they launched, and the TNT,Voodoo, et al for years before that. Yes,
  I was bitter that when it launched the most recent hardware it supported
  was 5 years old :)). All represent major changes to the look and feel of
  the games – it’s hard to overestimate the visual impact of these.
  Runescape did their mega update (“Runescape 2″) a couple of years ago.

  However … all are bringing games that were NOT cutting edge at launch up
  to a standard that is still well short of what is cutting edge now. This
  is important to understand: graphical quality is (according to what the
  successful MMO’s deploy) definitely not the main selling point for these
  games, unlike almost all other successful games you can possibly buy.

  So … what is that “development” that takes place after launch? It’s
  content, not engine. And even when it’s engine (better graphics, better
  physics) it’s always a minimal improvement by the standards of standalone
  PC and console titles of the time.

  For reference, many MMO’s after launch end up with LARGER development
  teams than they had in the 3-5 years of development leading up to the
  launch. All that extra content requires a lot of people (not to mention
  keeping all the old content working, updating it where it conflicts with
  new content, etc).

  On top of all that, though, there is the issue of customer support. When
  you launch a traditional game, that’s it. Done. Over the last 15 years
  there’s been a trend towards launching occasional “patches” and even minor
  content updates – but mostly bugfixes – which, incidentally, I suspect has
  been largely driven by publishers learning from the MMOs: releasing a
  content patch for an old game is a good way to get extra marketing /
  publicity and increase some sales. Bethesda’s TES4/Oblivion even went as
  far as to charge for the patches.

  MMO’s require a lot more work than that: since MMO’s are all monetized off
  continuous play (i.e. the more each player plays, the more money the
  publisher makes), either through monthly subscriptions or through in-game
  commerce, it is imperative to keep all the players playing as long as
  possible. If a player plays your MMO for 12 months instead of 6, you’ll
  make twice as much profit; if they play your console title for 12 months
  instead of 6, you’ll make no more money and will probably cannibalize your
  sales of the sequel.

  So. Total lifetime development cost is a lot more important, financially,
  to an MMO than the pre-launch development cost.

3. The way the core logic works now is not how it will work forever

  Sooner or later, you nerf.

  Usually because you(r players) discover a disproportionately powerful game
  tactic in PvP that you didn’t think of which is unbalancing and ruining
  the game, and so you “have” to fix it.

  Sooner or later, you choose to break every absolute rule of your game
  logic, because a new expansion wants to slightly redefine and “freshen”
  the core game.

  And that means you have to be able to break every rule you ever hardcoded
  into the game-logic. Worse, it means you have to be able to handle the
  fallout (all the bugs that the change introduces, plus all the invisible
  bugs that were originally there but had no noticeable effect and now
  suddenly have visible effect, the new security holes, etc).

  Since the ongoing development of the game (post launch) is greater than
  the initial development in scope and cost, over the lifetime of the game
  it is more important to make it easy to change the core logic – and to
  react to side effects of that change – than to be able to make the core
  logic easily in the first place.

4. Even a moderately successful MMO generates gigabytes of data every 24 hours

  The progress of every player of the MMO has to be uniquely independently
  tracked, so that the game can remember for each player which quests
  they’ve completed, which equipment they have, etc. With 100,000 players,
  that data racks up quickly. A lot of it can be thrown away every day (for
  instance, you don’t generally need the history of how many hitpoints you
  had at the end of every day), but a lot of it has to be kept forever
  (whether you completed a given quest, and for some quests how exactly you
  completed it).

  However, the trend at the moment is towards keeping ALL this data, in the
  form of historical records of your personal game experience – e.g. the
  automatic “blog” that is created whilst you play Vanguard, which e.g.
  updates every time you level up, or kill a monster, or die, etc.

  This latter kind of data alone is generated at the rate of around 30Gb
  every 24 hours.

  And any of that data that gets used in-game (e.g. even if just referenced
  in a conversation with an NPC) has to be programmatically accessible.

  Ultimately, MMOs have to store, retrieve, and update vast databases. There
  is a huge decades-old industry that specializes in providing software to
  manage databases of this size and larger, but MMO developers don’t like
  SQL and Relational programming. This is a real problem – relational
  databases can handle the load, but relational programming is fundamentally
  incompatible with Object-Oriented programming. The net effect is that
  programmers who have to write their data to disk find it boring,
  difficult, and irritating to do – and that leads to mistakes and greatly
  increased bugs, as well as reduced functionality (because no-one wants to
  write or add to the code to add the new features more than they absolutely
  have to).

MMO Development Priorities

  The net effect of these aspects of MMO development is that the long term
  profitability of an MMO can be greatly affected by a bunch of simple
  issues:

  - How much effort is required to change the data used to describe an in-
    game item
  - How much effort is required to add (or remove) new (old) types of in-
    game item
  - How re-usable is the content
  - How easy it is in practice (i.e. how much coding is needed) to re-use
    re-usable content
  - How much specialist knowledge of the game code, overall game design, and
    details of the game systems is needed to modify the content and logic
    (can new team members be effective as the team who originally wrote the
    game pre-launch?)
  - How exportable is the data generated by playing the game (progress,
    achievements, player-history, etc)
  - How analysable is the game-data generated by playing (to make decisions
    about what to change, and check that game improvements have improed
    things)
  - How modifiable the core-content is
  - How easy it is to change individual rules and check the side-effects of
    the changes
  - How many of all the above changes can be done WITHOUT requiring a
    programmer (can designers change code themselves? can artists?)
  - How much can third-party specialist systems be utilised for server-side
    service provision

  Leading to a few rules of thumb that are often adopted by commercial MMOs:


  - Use commercial databases for all persistent data-storage

  - Use Relational Databases and allow arbitrary general data requests

  - Implement as much as possible of the game-logic as raw data rather than
    as compiled data (and preferably as data rather than source code)

  - Use standard but simple to learn scripting languages where data isn’t
    expressive enough

  - Do lots and lots of testing during development
    Do even more testing post-launch EVERY SINGLE TIME you consider changing
    ANYTHING on the live servers

  Some of those aren’t very effective (too vague), others are horrifically
  expensive (it takes a lot of people to “test EVERYTHING” every time you
  make a change to a live game). None of them are great for performance in
  and of themselves (although they can be made highly performant, that
  requires extra work), and none of them are “programmer friendly” – in
  fact, they’re all deliberately programmer UNfriendly, being in there for
  the benefit of non- programmers.

  NB: this is in no way a comprehensive or exhaustive list; I’m trying to
  give merely a flavour of the thing here for people who aren’t familiar
  with typical MMO dev processes. I don’t know any real MMO that faces only
  those challenges and uses only those rules of thumb, but they are
  indicative of what is used, and very very roughly explain why those things
  are used.
</code></pre>
<p>Entity Systems are the future of MMOG development 5</p>
<pre><code>Previously, I posed some questions and said I’d answer them later:

    how do you define the archetypes for your entities?
    how do you instantiate multiple new entities from a single archetype?
    how do you STORE in-memory entities so that they can be re-instantiated later on? 

Let’s answer those first.

A quick warning…

I’m going to write this post using Relational terminology. This is deliberate, for several reasons:

    It’s the most-correct practical way of describing runtime Entities
    It’s fairly trivial to see how to implement this using static and dynamic arrays – the reverse is not so obvious
    If you’re working on MMO’s, you should be using SQL for your persistence / back-end – which means you should already be thinking in Relations. 

If you know literally nothing about Relational data, RDBMS’s, and/or SQL (which is true of most game programmers, sadly), then here’s the idiot’s guide:

1. Everything is stored either in arrays, or in 2-dimensional arrays (“arrays-of-arrays”)

2. The index into the array is explicitly given a name, some text ending in “_id”; 
   but it’s still just an array-index: an increasing list of integers starting with 0, 1, 2, 3 … etc

3. Since you can’t have Dictionaries / HashMaps, you have to use 3 arrays-of-arrays to simulate one Dictionary. 
   This is very very typical, and so obvious you should be able to understand it easily when you see it below. 
   I only do it twice in this whole blog post.

4. Where I say “table, with N columns”, I mean “a variable-length array, with each element containing another array: 
   a fixed-size array of N items”

5. Where I say “row”, I mean “one of the fixed-size arrays of N items”

6. Rather than index the fixed-size arrays by integer from 0…N, we give a unique name (“column name”) to each index. 
   It makes writing code much much clearer. Since the arrays are fixed-size, 
   and we know all these column names before we write the program, this is no problem. 

How do you store all your data? Part 2: Runtime Entities + Components (“Objects”)

We’re doing part 2 first, because it’s the bit most of us think of first. 
When I go onto part 1 later, you’ll see why it’s “theoretically” the first part (and I called it “1”), 
even though when you write your game, you’ll probably write it second.

Table 3: all components

    (yes, I’m starting at 3. You’ll see why later ;))

    Table 3: components
    component_id | official name | human-readable description | table-name

There are N additional tables, one for each row in the Components table. 
Each row has a unique value of “table-name”, telling you which table to look at for this component. 
This is optional: you could instead use an algorithmic name based on some criteria like the official_name, 
or the component_id – but if you ever change the name of a component, or delete one and re-use the id, you’ll get problems.

…which combines with:…

Table 4: all entities / entity names

    Table 4 : entities
    entity_id | human-readable label FOR DEBUGGING ONLY

(really,you should only have 1 column in this table – but the second column is really useful when debugging your own ES implementation itself!)

Table 5: entity/component mapping

    Table 5 : entity_components
    entity_id | component_id | component_data_id

…to tell you which components are in which entity.

Technically, you could decide not to bother with Table 4; 
just look up the “unique values of entity_id from table 5” whenever you want to deal with Table 4.

But there are performance advantages for it – and you get to avoid some multi-threading issues 
(e.g. when creating a new entity, just create a blank entity in the entity table first, and that fast atomic action “reserves” an entity_id; 
without Table 4, you have to create ALL the components inside a Synchronized block of code, which is not good practice for MT code).

Tables 6,7,8…N+5: data for each component for each Entity

    Table N+5 : component_data_table_N
        component_data_id | [1..M columns, one column for each piece of data in your component]

These N tables store all the live, runtime, data for all the entity/component pairs.

How do you store all your data? Part 1: Assemblages (“Classes”)

So … you want to instantiate 10 new tanks into your game. How? Well, you could write code that says:

    int newTank()
    {
    int new_id = createNewEntity();

    // Attach components to the entity; they will have DEFAULT values

    createComponentAndAddTo( TRACKED_COMPONENT, new_id );
    createComponentAndAddTo( RENDERABLE_COMPONENT, new_id );
    createComponentAndAddTo( PHYSICS_COMPONENT, new_id );
    createComponentAndAddTo( GUN_COMPONENT, new_id );

    // Setup code that EDITS the data in each component, e.g:
    float[] gunData = getComponentDataForEntity( GUN_COMPONENT, new_id );
    gunData[ GUN_SIZE ] = 500;
    gunData[ GUN_DAMAGE ] = 10000;
    gunData[ GUN_FIRE_RATE ] = 0.001;
    setComponentDataForEntity( GUN_COMPONENT, new_id, gunData );

    return new_id;
    }

…and this is absolutely fine, so long as you remember ONE important thing: the above code is NOT inside a method “because you wanted it in an OOP class”. It’s inside a method “because you didn’t want to type it out every time you have a place in your code where you instantiate tanks”.

i.e. IT IS NOT OOP CODE! (the use of “methods” or “functions” is an idea that predates OOP by decades – it is coincidence that OOP *also* uses methods).

Or, in other words, if you do the above:

    NEVER put the above code into a Class on its own; especially NEVER NEVER split the above code into multiple methods, and use OOP inheritance to nest the calls to “createComponet” etc. 

But … it means that when you decide to split one Component into 2 Components, you’ll have to go through the source code for EVERY kind of game-object in your game, and change the source, then re-compile.

A neater way to handle this is to extend the ES to not only define “the components in each entity” but also “templates for creating new entities of a given human-readable type”. I previously referred to these templates as “assemblages” to avoid using the confusing term “template” which means many things already in OOP programming…

An assemblage needs:

Table 1: all Assemblages
    Table 1 : assemblages
    assemblage_id | default human-readable label (if you’re using that label in Table 1 above) | official name | human-readable description

Table 2: assemblage/component mapping
    Table 2 : assemblage_components
    assemblage_id   component_id

This table is cut-down version of Table 5 (entity/component mapping). 
This table provides the “template” for instantiating a new Entity: you pick an assemblage_id, find out all the component_id’s that exist for it, and then create a new Entity and instantiate one of each of those components and add it to the entity.

Table 3: all components
    Table 3: components
    component_id | official name | human-readable description | table-name

This is the same table from earlier (hence the silly numbering, just to make sure you noticed ;)) – it MUST be the same data, for obvious reasons.

Things to note

* DataForEntity( (entity-id) ) – fast lookup

If you know the entity-id, you may only need one table lookup to get the data for an entire component (Table5 is highly cacheable – it’s small, doesn’t change, and has fixed-size rows).

* Splitting Table 5 for performance or parallelization

When your SQL DB is too slow and you want to split to multiple DB servers, OR you’re not using SQL (doing it all in RAM) and want to fit inside your CPU cache, then you’ll split table 5 usually into N sub-tables, where N = number of unique component_id’s.

Why?

Because you run one System at a time, and each System needs all the components with the same component_id – but none of the components without that id.

* Isolation

The entire data for any given system is fully isolated into its own table. 
It’s easy to print to screen (for debugging), serialize (for saving / bug reports), 
parallelize (different components on different physical DB servers)

Metadata for editing your Assemblages and Entities

a.k.a. “Programmer/Designers: take note…”

It can be tempting to add extra columns to the Entity and Assemblage tables. Really, you shouldn’t be doing this. If you feel tempted to do that, add the extra data as more COMPONENTS – even if the data is NOTHING to do with your game (e.g. “name_of_designer_who_wrote_this_assemblage”).

Here’s a great feature of Entity Systems: it is (literally) trivial for the game to “remove” un-needed information at startup. If, for instance, you have vast amounts of metadata on each entity (e.g. “name of author”, “time of creation”, “what I had for lunch on the day when I wrote this entity”) – then it can all be included and AUTOMATICALLY be stripped-out at runtime. It can even be included in the application, but “not loaded” at startup – so you get the benefits of keeping all the debug data hanging around, with no performance overhead.

You can’t do that with OOP: you can get some *similar* benefits by doing C-Header-File Voodoo, and writing lots of proprietary code … but … so much is dependent upon your header files that unless you really know what you’re doing you probably shouldn’t go there.

Another great example is Subversion / Git / CVS / etc metadata: you can attach to each Entity the full Subversion metadata for that Entity, by creating a “SubversionInformation” System / Component. Then at runtime, if something crashes, load up the SubversionInformation system, and include it in the crash log. Of course, the Components for the SubversionInformation system aren’t actually loader yet – because the system wasn’t used inside the main game. No problem – now you’ve started the system (in your crash-handler code), it’ll pull in its own data from disk, attach it to whatever entities are in-memory, and all works beautifully.

Wrapping up…

I wanted to cover other things – like transmitting all this stuff over the network (and maybe cover how to do so both fast and efficiently) – but I realise now that this post is going to be long enough as it is.

Next time, I hope to talk about that (binary serialization / loading), and editors (how do you make it easy to edit / design your own game?).

<p>Modeling State and Behavior</p>
<pre><code>An ECS (Entity-Component-System) framework
- provides a structured way to create objects in the scene and dynamically compose those objects at runtime.
- avoids the rigidity of an inheritance-based approach while opening up many new possibilities for code design and reuse. 

This API makes it trivial to create, destroy, retrieve, and modify components while doing its best to get out of the developer's way.
The engine needs to provide a way to add new state data as it's created by the game.
The engine needs to provide a way for the game to specify which behavior routines should be running at any given time.
There needs to be a way for behavior routines to read state data each frame.
There needs to be a way for behavior routines to modify (meaning add new data, remove existing data, and modify existing data) state data each frame.
</code></pre>
<p>A Component-Oriented World Model</p>
<pre><code>In a component-oriented system you create &quot;entities&quot; that can have a variety of components attached. 
Entities themselves don't have any state and are usually not the direct target of behavior routines, 
instead the components contain the state data and behavior routines run the simulation for one or more components each frame. 

Where in a more traditionally object-oriented setup you'd define a struct and give it different member variables to define its functionality, 
in a component-oriented system most of that functionality is composed dynamically at runtime.

    // Only specifies the data for a bullet, other state data like position and
    // what mesh it has are provided by other components like `Transform` and `Mesh`.
    #[derive(Debug, Clone, Component)]
    struct Bullet {
        pub velocity: Vector3,
        pub damage: f32,
    }

    // Dynamically construct a &quot;bullet&quot; by creating an entity and giving it
    // all of the properties of a bullet.
    fn create_bullet(velocity: Vector3, damage: f32) -&gt; Entity {
        let entity = Entity::new();

        entity.assign(Transform::new());
        entity.assign(Mesh::new(&quot;meshes/bullet_mesh&quot;));
        entity.assign(SphereCollider::new(0.1));
        entity.assign(Bullet {
            velocity: velocity,
            damage: damage
        });

        entity
    }

In the component-oriented version there's nothing that statically declares that bullet entities will always have a transform and a mesh component, in fact there's no direct definition for a bullet entity; They're always composed dynamically at runtime to create ad hoc game objects.

This style is well suited for many games because it allows for game objects to change composition on the fly making dynamic game worlds easier to create. 

Of course all things come at a cost and here that cost is not knowing statically what the composition of your entities is. 

Whereas in the object-oriented version you can simply define the Bullet type as having a Transform as a member variable in the component-oriented version you can't be sure that the Transform ( or any other component) will be there. 

The possibility of a component's absence must be handled at runtime which incurs overhead even when, by the design of your game, you know that the component must be there. 

Depending on implementation you can mitigate this cost (e.g. in Unity you can cache off references to components) but the nature of a component system is to be dynamic and that will always be more costly than a more static alternative.
</code></pre>
<p>The Ideal Component System</p>
<pre><code>Example:

let entity = Entity::new(); // Construct objects with `new()` like normal.
entity.assign(Transform::new()); // Assign directly to the entity.

let mut transform = entity.get::&lt;Transform&gt;(); // Get components directly from the entity.
transform.position = Point::new(0.0, 0.0, 0.0); // Directly access component members.
transform.translate(Vector3::new(1.0, 2.0, 3.0)); // Call methods on components.

entity.destroy_component::&lt;Transform&gt;(); // Destroy components directly through the entity.
entity.destroy(); // Destroying the entity destroys all components and consumes the entity making it unusable.

Example behavior associated with BulletComponent:

impl Behavior for BulletComponent {
    fn update(&amp;mut self) {
        // Retrieve the transform for the bullet and move it based on the velocity.
        let mut transform = Transform::get(self.entity).unwrap();
        transform.translate(self.velocity * time::delta());

        // Slow down the bullet slightly over time. Should loose 10% speed per second.
        self.velocity *= 1.0 - (0.1 * time::delta());

        // Check for collisions and apply damage to the first one with a health
        // component. Destroy the bullet once it has collided.
        let collider = Collider::get(self.entity);
        for other_entity in collider.collisions() {
            if let Some(mut health) = Health::get(other_entity) {
                health.health -= self.damage;
                self.destroy();
                break;
            }
        }
    }
}

Making an entity and managing its components:

// Construct objects with `new()` like normal.
let mut entity = Entity::new();

// Assign components directly to the entity.
entity.assign(Transform::new()); 

// Get components directly from the entity.
let transform = entity.get::&lt;Transform&gt;();

// Directly access component members.
transform.position = Point::new(0.0, 0.0, 0.0); 

// Call methods on components and mutate them.
transform.translate(Vector3::new(1.0, 2.0, 3.0));

// Destroy components directly through the entity.
entity.destroy_component::&lt;Transform&gt;();

// Destroying the entity destroys all components and makes the entity unusable.
entity.destroy();

And implementing components and behaviors:

pub struct BulletComponent {
    velocity: Vector3,
    damage: f32,
}

impl Updatefor BulletComponent {
    fn update(&amp;mut self) {
        // Retrieve the transform for the bullet and move it based on the velocity.
        let transform = self.entity.get::&lt;Transform&gt;();
        transform.translate(self.velocity * time::delta());

        // Slow down the bullet slightly over time.
        self.velocity *= 1.0 - (0.1 * time::delta());

        // Check for collisions and apply damage to the first one with a health
        // component. Destroy the bullet once it has collided.
        let collider = self.entity.get::&lt;ColliderComponent&gt;();
        for other_entity in collider.collisions() {
            let health = other_entity.get::&lt;HealthComponent&gt;()
            health.health -= self.damage;
            self.entity.destroy();
            break;
        }
    }
}

- Construct objects using idiomatic practices. 
  That means creating entities with Entity::new() and components like Transform with Transform::new(). 
- Operate directly on the entity rather than passing it around as a parameter. 
  For example entity.assign(Transform::new()) and entity.get::&lt;Transform&gt;(). 
  This aligns with the way that developers tend to think about their game entities and makes for a fairly intuitive API.
- Get references directly to components. 
  Entity::get&lt;T&gt;() should return a &amp;T, &amp;mut T, or maybe (maybe) something like Ref&lt;T&gt;. 
  This keeps type signatures simple and intuitive and avoids complicated type signatures.
- Destroying an entity destroys its components. 
  entity.destroy() should automatically handle cleanup of all component data associated with the entity. 
  This is to keep the management burden on game code low.
- Behaviors can be defined for components, meaning a behavior routine can be defined that takes the component as the self parameter. 
  This makes it easy to write behaviors in terms of a specific component in an object-oriented fashion 
  without having to manually iterate over all components of a given type.
- Standalone behaviors can be defined, 
  meaning a behavior routine can be defined that doesn't take a self parameter or whose self parameter isn't a component type. 
  This allows more flexibility in behavior routines by not having to create a dummy entity and component in order to execute some behavior.
- Pass Entity objects around to reference entities in the world. 
  It's important to be able to easily reference specific entities from various pieces of code; 
  Enemies need to know the player's entity so they can attack it, 
  collisions needs to keep track of the pairs of entities that collided, etc. 
  That's what the Entity type is for, so it ought to be possible to pass Entity objects around and copy them as necessary.
</code></pre>
<p>Where Things Fall Apart</p>
<pre><code>Unfortunately, the API as proposed above violates one of Rust's core safety principles: No shared mutable state. 
For our purposes &quot;shared mutable state&quot; refers to having a mutable reference to some data at the same time as having another mutable or immutable reference to that same data.
In discussing the proposed API, &quot;some data&quot; is always a component.

Under the current design it's trivial to write an example that results in multiple mutable references to the same component.

pub fn make_position_same(first: Entity, second: Entity) {
    let first_transform = first.get::&lt;Transform&gt;();
    let second_transform = second.get::&lt;Transform&gt;();

    first_transform.position = second_transform.position;
}

In this example we take two entities, retrieve their Transform component, and set the first transform's position to be the same as the second's. 
As long as first and second are different that will work, but if they're the same entity then first_trans and second_trans will both be mutable references to the same Transform object. 

Interestingly, in this case passing the same entity in twice likely wouldn't cause a crash but it probably would indicate a bug in the game code; 
If the developer had two entities and expected them to both be moved to the same point after the function was called they'd be pretty surprised when neither of them moved.
</code></pre>
<p>Introduce Runtime Checks</p>
<pre><code>One way we could adhere to Rust's rule of &quot;no shared, mutable state&quot; is to track ownership at runtime.

Currently Entity::get() is declared like this:

    pub fn get&lt;T: Component&gt;(&amp;mut self) -&gt; &amp;mut T { ... }

Where it returns a mutable reference directly to the component. Instead we could change it to return a wrapper type that can track borrows:

    pub fn get&lt;T: Component&gt;(&amp;mut self) -&gt; RefMut&lt;T&gt; { ... }

The RefMut type internally tracks that the component is borrowed and marks that the component is no longer borrowed once it goes out of scope. 
If a second call to get::&lt;T&gt;() is made while the component is already borrowed the engine will panic with an error message to the developer:

    pub fn make_position_same(first: Entity, second: Entity) {
        let first_transform = first.get::&lt;Transform&gt;();
        let second_transform = second.get::&lt;Transform&gt;(); // Panics here if first == second.

        first_transform.position = second_transform.position;
    }

While this method is successful in enforcing Rust's safety rules, it does so both at the cost of runtime performance and ergonomics: The cost of tracking borrows at runtime likely isn't large but it's still frustrating since Rust can already do that at compile time, and I can tell you from experience that writing gameplay code under those conditions is practically impossible.
</code></pre>
<p>Make The Engine Explicit</p>
<pre><code>Under the above design components are borrowed from the entity using Entity::get(). 
Rust's ownership rules then naturally tie the borrow to the lifetime of the Entity object and ensures that the object isn't destroyed while the component is being borrowed. 
But the Entity object doesn't actually own the component data, the engine does. 
The reason Rust can't track ownership in this case is because Entity::get() has to be doing some trickery to get at the engine and retrieve the component. 
If we change things around such that game code has access to the engine we can get Rust to track ownership again:

pub fn make_position_same(engine: &amp;mut Engine, first: Entity, second: Entity) {
    let first_transform = engine.get::&lt;Transform&gt;(first);

    // ERROR: Trying to borrow from the compiler while there is already
    // a mutable borrow for `first_transform`.
    let second_transform = engine.get::&lt;Transform&gt;(second);

    first_transform.position = second_transform.position;
}

In the new example we pass a reference to the engine into the function along with the two entities. Now when we want to retrieve the transforms we use the entities as keys, similar to accessing elements stored in a HashMap. 
Lo and behold, doing so allows the compiler to track how the borrows and it generates an error. 
We can fix this error by slightly reordering the function:

pub fn make_position_same(engine: &amp;mut Engine, first: Entity, second: Entity) {
    let position = {
        let second_transform = engine.get::&lt;Transform&gt;(second);
        second_transform.position()
    };

    let first_transform = engine.get::&lt;Transform&gt;(first);
    first_transform.position = position;
}

Now Rust can tell that there's no conflict in the borrows, and even if first and second are the same entity there's no chance of error.

One downside to this change is now we have to pass the engine to every function that wants to access game state. 
Considering that almost all functions want to do so this becomes a massive pain. 
The other issue is that we lose the ability to have mutable references to multiple components at once. 
In fact, if we have a mutable reference to any component we can't have a reference to any other component. 
While this example was easily rewritten to compile under these constraints, more complex cases quickly become unwieldy. 
The problem stems from the fact that ownership is now tracked at a very course granularity; 
Borrowing any component requires that the entire engine be borrowed, 
even though we can trivially confirm by hand that it's safe to both mutably borrow two components of different types.
</code></pre>
<p>Make Entity A Handle</p>
<pre><code>Implicit in the above examples is the assumption that Entity doesn't contain any component data, 
that it's just a numeric identifier used internally by the engine to determine which components are associated with each other. 
The advantage of this design is that Entity objects can easily be passed around in order to refer to entities in the world.
An enemy AI can have a member target: Entity to reference what player it should follow, 
or you could pass around an NPC's Entity in order for other parts of the game to reference that character. 
Treating Entity as a simple ID instead of a more complex &quot;handle&quot; type makes it much easier to reference entities 
from various parts of the code base.

That said, if we have Entity be a &quot;handle&quot; we could address the problem of borrows being too course. 
Rather than a cheap ID value, Entity would be a unique object like Box or Vec. 
Accessing an entity's components requires having unique access to the entity, 
either by owning it or by having a unique reference (i.e. &amp;mut Entity). 

In the make_positions_same example we would take first and second by mutable reference:

pub fn make_position_same(first: &amp;mut Entity, second: &amp;mut Entity) {
    let first_transform = first.get_mut::&lt;Transform&gt;();
    let second_transform = second.get::&lt;Transform&gt;();

    first_transform.set_position(second_transform.position());
}

All the issues from the previous examples are now resolved: Rust will statically prevent the same entity from being passed in twice, 
and we can safely have references to both transforms at once. 
We also gain back the ability to borrow components directly from the Entity rather than having to go through the engine, 
which allows us to safely borrow multiple components at once.

But, just as before, this design has consequences. 
Under this design it's unclear how one would be able to reference entities from within game code. 
For example, let's look at a simple enemy AI that moves towards a target entity at a fixed speed:

#[derive(Component)]
pub struct Enemy {
    pub velocity: Vector3,
    pub target: Entity, // Now Enemy owns its target?
}

impl Update for Enemy {
    fn update(&amp;mut self) {
        let transform = self.entity.get::&lt;Transform&gt;();
        let target_transform = self.target.get::&lt;Transform&gt;();

        let move_dir = target_transform.position() - transform.position();
        transform.translate(move_dir.normalized() * self.velocity * time::delta());
    }
}

Under the previous designs, where Entity was a weak reference, this example works. 
But if Entity is a handle type then Enemy has to own its target in order to have access to it. 
There's also the nasty question of how a component knows what entity it belongs to. 
Under the previous designs I've been assuming that the game engine is able to secretly inject an entity member into all component types, 
but once Entity is a handle that has weird implications; Now all components &quot;own&quot; their entity and have mutable access to it, 
which entirely undermines the point of making Entity a handle.
</code></pre>
<p>Comment: </p>
<pre><code>Most game engines already handle this problem; there are two entity types.

One, something like EntityRef, is stored in data structures that want to reference another entity. It's something like a weak pointer; you obviously want components to be able to reference each other, but you also don't want those references to stop you from doing something like destroying the entity. A homing missle loses its target if the target is killed for some other reason, and needs to be able to reason about what to do in that case.

The second, EntityHandle, is the result of a (potentially failing) lock operation on an EntityRef. This represents a live entity pointer, and only lives on the stack.

This design is actually very Rust-y; EntityRef can have lock and lockMut operations, and can use runtime tracking (perhaps only enabled in debug builds) to verify that Rust's shared mutability constraints are followed. These operations are also potentially failing, and you usually write a few different variations; panic if fail, return Optional, return Result including a reason why the lock failed (was the entity destroyed? or the component? or something else?)

This design is commonly used in C++ game engines where the list of entities is a giant array; an EntityRef is then a versioned index pointing at a particular entry of that array but only if the version matches.

One fail with Unity is that they attempt to replicate this design but hide it from you; a C# reference to a component keeps that component's C# information alive (due to GC), even if it has been destroyed, but the reference compares equal to null due to UnityEngine:Component overriding the equality operator. A better design would make that explicit.

I had considered this but decided not to include it in the article to keep it simple. Having a weak-strong reference combo is an interesting idea but it's not materially different than the example using runtime checking because it doesn't handle mutability well. As you propose it, EntityHandle and EntityRef behave like Rc and Weak, where you need to do a runtime check to convert from EntityRef to EntityHandle. But Rc doesn't allow mutable access to its contents because then you'd have shared mutability. You have to use Rc&lt;RefCell&gt;, which introduces a runtime check and fails (by panicking) if there's already a mutable borrow of the shared data. At that point you run right back into the usability issues that happen with the simpler runtime checked version, and trust me those issues make trying to write even the simplest game a huge pain. Tt also makes sense that this design would work in C++ since shared mutability isn't considered an issue in that language.

Still, it's an interesting idea and feels like it's really close to working. I'll keep it mind going forward.
