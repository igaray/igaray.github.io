So we can only fight the State or Capitalism by wholly replacing the system.

We do this by:

Replacing systems of food.
  Community gardens, farms, and cooperative distribution networks.
Replacing systems of work.
  While this can be done by "taking over" industry, it can also be done by
  making your own worker-cooperatives. Get a cool idea and start a business,
  it's not impossible. Of course, this should never stop our struggle within
  certain capitalist industries for people without the means for making their
  own.
Replacing systems of health.
  Doing community check-ups with nurses, doctors, or even those with basic
  training for smaller, easier stuff.
Replacing systems of justice.
  We need to not only fight against repression, but to create alternative
  methods for resolving community disputes.

As replacing systems of work, it's two-part.

One, unions/workers-councils/assemblies taking over industry (as the current
example in Greece). Or, replacing them with our own enterprises. For instance,
food; I can buy/rent land to use as a "base" to start. This way we can always
have food, we remove a decent portion of our purchase of food from the general
market, and do it ourselves, and distribute it to our network. The same can be
done in almost any industry.

I'm not as good as putting things into words as others, but I'll list off some
stuff for you, and feel free to ask for elaboration.

- Organizing a workplace horizontally rather than vertically (unionize)
- Plant a community garden
- Provide food and help for the lower class
- Speak out against atrocities like racism, sexism, classism, and the like
- Show solidarity with those who could use an additional voice
- Protest.
- Question everything

What about some/all of these things?

You need to set yourself up (and your friends, community members, etc.) to
survive without the state. There are tons of peaceful, nonviolent ways to do
this:

- Start a garden, community garden, or neighborhood garden. Maybe get into
  /r/guerillagardening.
- Engage in /r/agorism. Agorism is a revolutionary left-libertarian political
  philosophy that advocates the goal of bringing about a society in which all
  relations between people are voluntary exchanges by means of counter-economics.
- Start a Volunteer group. Just a website for your local area, which lists ads
  for people that require volunteer assistance. Things like yard work, moving,
  etc. Also, put an ad on craigslist offering your volunteer services, either
  for free or for a very small fee (to at least pay for gas).
- Get on /r/couchsurfing and airbnb.com. Governments usually charge a hotel-room
  occupancy tax, so using this deprives the state and corporations of revenue,
  while also saving other people money.
- Start a neighborhood mini-library. Fill it with good books, but throw some
  anarchism books in there too.
- Own gold/silver/bitcoins, and get most of your money out of banks and out of
  worthless fiat currency.
- Buy things used on craigslist/yard sales. Trade with gold/silver.
  Help your neighbors by helping yourself.
- Brew your own beer, grow your own tobacco. No more sin taxes.
- Plan your own retirement. Don't count on SS or Medicare being available, since
  it might not be. Start saving/investing now, and do it in good companies that
  treat their employees well and offer good products/services.
- Host dinners at your house/apt where everyone brings something.
  Helps to save money, and you can even have discussions afterwards.
- Buy a firearm. Learn how to use it. Don't rely on the State for protection.
- Start a neighborhood watch that actually does looks out for crime.
  Take jobs away from the draconian police department.
- Almost forgot: check out /r/frugal, /r/minimalism, /r/simpleliving,
  /r/dumpsterdiving, and /r/anticonsumption. The less you consume, the less
  money you give to the State and corporations.
- Local gift exchange and barter
- Collective DIY; similar to the above volunteer group, but focused on fixing
  things. Like starting a local HackerSpace.
- Buy some books about your health. The two biggest areas to learn about are
  exercise and nutrition. Most of our health 'problems' are due to a sedentary
  lifestyle and change in diet. There's tons of books and resources out there,
  start to learn about them so you can stay out of the doctors office and keep
  more of your money. But, you should also be able to recognize when you really
  need professional help as well.
