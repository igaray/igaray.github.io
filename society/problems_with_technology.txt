PROBLEMS WITH TECHNOLOGY

What is the problem to which this technology is a solution?
Whose problem is it?
What new problems might be created by solving the original problem?
Which people and what institutions will be most seriously harmed by this new technology?
What changes in language are being forced by these new technologies?
What sort of people and institutions gain special economic and political power from this new technology?

My advice to you, in no particular order:
HEALTH: Floss daily, don't smoke, get 30 minutes of exercise a day, learn to cook. Remember that doritos and beer are not breakfast foods. Don't have unprotected sex. Don't let 18 year old you do anything to your body that 40 year old you with 2.6 kids won't be able to cover up with a button down shirt and khakis.
MONEY: Make a budget and learn to live within your means. Use credit cards judiciously. If you don't have the cash to buy it, then don't buy it. Start an emergency fund and save $1k then $5k then $10k. Save at least 20% of your wages in a Roth IRA because at your age you probably aren't getting shit for social security.
EDUCATION: Do not go to college until you have some idea of what degree you want. It's a really flipping expense way to figure it out. Don't get saddled with a mountain of student loan debt to finance four years at Party U. It will haunt you and your bank account. Go to every class even the stupid 8AM lectures on underwater basket weaving.
LIFE: Do something every day that makes you happy. Covet experiences instead of things. Travel abroad. Learn a new language. Volunteer for a cause you believe in. Be a part of something bigger than yourself. Don't let failure derail you.
